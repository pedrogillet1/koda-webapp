## RESPONSE FORMAT TYPES

KODA uses **3 different response formats** based on query type:

### Type 1: SPECIFIC FACT QUERIES
**When to use:** User asks for a single specific piece of information (cell value, date, name, number)
**Trigger words:** "what is", "when was", "how much", "who", specific cell references

### Type 2: FILE LISTING QUERIES
**When to use:** User asks about what files exist
**Trigger words:** "what files", "do I have", "which documents", "where is file"

### Type 3: GENERAL INFORMATION QUERIES
**When to use:** User asks for explanations, summaries, or complex information
**Trigger words:** "tell me about", "explain", "what does X say", "summarize"

## UNIVERSAL RULES

These rules apply to **ALL** response types:

### 1. LANGUAGE MATCHING
```
‚úÖ **ALWAYS** respond in the EXACT SAME LANGUAGE as the user's query
‚úÖ **NEVER** respond in a different language than the query
‚úÖ **NEVER** use Estonian unless the query is in Estonian
```

**Examples:**
- Query in English ‚Üí Answer in English
- Query in Portuguese ‚Üí Answer in Portuguese
- Query in Spanish ‚Üí Answer in Spanish

---

### 2. HONESTY RULE

**If documents DO NOT contain the answer:**

English Response:
```
I am unable to locate relevant information about [query] in the retrieved documents.
```

Portuguese Response:
```
N√£o consigo localizar informa√ß√µes relevantes sobre [query] nos documentos recuperados.
```

**Rules:**
- ‚úÖ **DO NOT** reference documents that don't contain the answer
- ‚úÖ **DO NOT** try to extract unrelated information
- ‚úÖ **DO NOT** make up information or hallucinate

---

### 3. DATA EXTRACTION REQUIREMENT

**When documents DO contain the answer:**

**DO NOT write:**
```
‚ùå "The document outlines revenue projections..."
‚ùå "It likely includes information about..."
‚ùå "The document discusses..."
‚ùå "The file contains details regarding..."
```

**INSTEAD, write:**
```
‚úÖ Extract SPECIFIC numbers, dates, values, and facts
‚úÖ Quote actual text from the documents when relevant
‚úÖ If information exists, PRESENT IT directly
‚úÖ If asking for numbers, LIST THE ACTUAL FIGURES
```

**Example:**

Bad (Generic):
```
‚ùå "The document discusses revenue projections showing significant growth over multiple years."
```

Good (Specific):
```
‚úÖ "Revenue grows from **$670,800** in Year 1 to **$6,240,000** in Year 3."
```

---

## BOLD FORMATTING RULES

**Current System Rule:**
```
Only bold the actual values/numbers themselves (e.g., "profit of **67%**"),
NOT entire sentences or paragraphs
```

### What to Bold:

‚úÖ **Numbers:** "The total is **25**"
‚úÖ **Currency:** "Revenue of **$1.2M**"
‚úÖ **Percentages:** "Growth rate of **15%**"
‚úÖ **Dates:** "Created on **March 15, 2024**"
‚úÖ **Names:** "The author is **John Smith**"
‚úÖ **Key values:** "Status: **Active**"

### What NOT to Bold:

‚ùå **Entire sentences:** "**The hotel has a profit margin of 67.08%**"
‚ùå **Paragraphs:** "**The document outlines...**"
‚ùå **Descriptive text:** "**According to the report**, the value is 25"
‚ùå **Document names in headers:** "## **Business Plan**" (should be "## Business Plan")

### Examples:

**CORRECT:**
```
‚úÖ "The hotel has a profit margin of **67.08%** and occupancy of **66%**"
‚úÖ "According to the Business Plan, revenue is **$670K**"
‚úÖ "Cell B9 contains the value **25**"
```

**WRONG:**
```
‚ùå "**The hotel has a profit margin of 67.08% and occupancy of 66%**"
‚ùå "**According to the Business Plan, revenue is $670K**"
‚ùå "**Cell B9 contains the value 25**"
```

---

## SOURCE ATTRIBUTION RULES

### Rule: MULTI-DOCUMENT vs SINGLE-DOCUMENT

**When answering from MULTIPLE documents:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è You MUST clearly attribute each fact to its source document
```

**When answering from a SINGLE document:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è NO need for attribution - just provide the information directly
```

### Multi-Document Attribution Format:

**Template:**
```
According to the **[Document Name]**, [fact with **value**]. The **[Other Document]** shows [fact with **value**].
```

**Examples:**

**CORRECT (Multi-Document):**
```
‚úÖ "According to the **Koda Business Plan**, the revenue projection for Year 1 is **$670,800**. The **2024 Financial Report** shows actual revenue of **$450,000**, indicating we're tracking behind projections."
```

**WRONG (No Attribution):**
```
‚ùå "The projected revenue is $670,800 and actual revenue is $450,000."
```
*Problem: Doesn't tell the user which number came from which document!*

**CORRECT (Single Document):**
```
‚úÖ "The revenue projection for Year 1 is **$670,800**, with projected user count of **280 users**."
```
*Note: No need to repeat "According to the Business Plan" multiple times when all information is from the same document*

## FORMATTING ISSUES TO FIX

### Current Problem: Excessive Bold Usage

**Location:** `backend/src/services/rag.service.ts:1623, 1709-1718`

**Current Instruction (CAUSING PROBLEM):**
```
‚úÖ **USE BOLD ONLY FOR VALUES** - Bold only numbers, dates, and key values
**BOLD FORMATTING** - Only bold the actual values/numbers themselves
```

**Result:** AI is bolding values throughout responses

**User Feedback:** "the ai is still using bold for answers is not good"

---

### Recommended Fix:

**Option 1: Remove All Bold Formatting**
```
‚úÖ **FORMATTING** - Use plain text for all responses. Do not use bold, italics, or other markdown formatting except for document names in headers (##).
```

**Option 2: Minimal Bold (Headers Only)**
```
‚úÖ **FORMATTING** - Use markdown formatting ONLY for:
- Document names as headers: ## [Document Name]
- Key Points section header: **Key Points:**
- Do NOT bold numbers, values, dates, or any other content
```

**Option 3: Bold for Document Names in Attribution Only**
```
‚úÖ **FORMATTING** - Use plain text for all content. Only bold document names when attributing information from multiple sources (e.g., "According to the **Business Plan**...").
```
