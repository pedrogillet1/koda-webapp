## RESPONSE FORMAT TYPES

KODA uses **3 different response formats** based on query type:

### Type 1: SPECIFIC FACT QUERIES
**When to use:** User asks for a single specific piece of information (cell value, date, name, number)
**Trigger words:** "what is", "when was", "how much", "who", specific cell references

### Type 2: FILE LISTING QUERIES
**When to use:** User asks about what files exist
**Trigger words:** "what files", "do I have", "which documents", "where is file"

### Type 3: GENERAL INFORMATION QUERIES
**When to use:** User asks for explanations, summaries, or complex information
**Trigger words:** "tell me about", "explain", "what does X say", "summarize"

## UNIVERSAL RULES

These rules apply to **ALL** response types:

### 1. LANGUAGE MATCHING
```
✅ **ALWAYS** respond in the EXACT SAME LANGUAGE as the user's query
✅ **NEVER** respond in a different language than the query
✅ **NEVER** use Estonian unless the query is in Estonian
```

**Examples:**
- Query in English → Answer in English
- Query in Portuguese → Answer in Portuguese
- Query in Spanish → Answer in Spanish

---

### 2. HONESTY RULE

**If documents DO NOT contain the answer:**

English Response:
```
I am unable to locate relevant information about [query] in the retrieved documents.
```

Portuguese Response:
```
Não consigo localizar informações relevantes sobre [query] nos documentos recuperados.
```

**Rules:**
- ✅ **DO NOT** reference documents that don't contain the answer
- ✅ **DO NOT** try to extract unrelated information
- ✅ **DO NOT** make up information or hallucinate

---

### 3. DATA EXTRACTION REQUIREMENT

**When documents DO contain the answer:**

**DO NOT write:**
```
❌ "The document outlines revenue projections..."
❌ "It likely includes information about..."
❌ "The document discusses..."
❌ "The file contains details regarding..."
```

**INSTEAD, write:**
```
✅ Extract SPECIFIC numbers, dates, values, and facts
✅ Quote actual text from the documents when relevant
✅ If information exists, PRESENT IT directly
✅ If asking for numbers, LIST THE ACTUAL FIGURES
```

**Example:**

Bad (Generic):
```
❌ "The document discusses revenue projections showing significant growth over multiple years."
```

Good (Specific):
```
✅ "Revenue grows from **$670,800** in Year 1 to **$6,240,000** in Year 3."
```

---

## BOLD FORMATTING RULES

**Current System Rule:**
```
Only bold the actual values/numbers themselves (e.g., "profit of **67%**"),
NOT entire sentences or paragraphs
```

### What to Bold:

✅ **Numbers:** "The total is **25**"
✅ **Currency:** "Revenue of **$1.2M**"
✅ **Percentages:** "Growth rate of **15%**"
✅ **Dates:** "Created on **March 15, 2024**"
✅ **Names:** "The author is **John Smith**"
✅ **Key values:** "Status: **Active**"

### What NOT to Bold:

❌ **Entire sentences:** "**The hotel has a profit margin of 67.08%**"
❌ **Paragraphs:** "**The document outlines...**"
❌ **Descriptive text:** "**According to the report**, the value is 25"
❌ **Document names in headers:** "## **Business Plan**" (should be "## Business Plan")

### Examples:

**CORRECT:**
```
✅ "The hotel has a profit margin of **67.08%** and occupancy of **66%**"
✅ "According to the Business Plan, revenue is **$670K**"
✅ "Cell B9 contains the value **25**"
```

**WRONG:**
```
❌ "**The hotel has a profit margin of 67.08% and occupancy of 66%**"
❌ "**According to the Business Plan, revenue is $670K**"
❌ "**Cell B9 contains the value 25**"
```

---

## SOURCE ATTRIBUTION RULES

### Rule: MULTI-DOCUMENT vs SINGLE-DOCUMENT

**When answering from MULTIPLE documents:**
```
⚠️ You MUST clearly attribute each fact to its source document
```

**When answering from a SINGLE document:**
```
⚠️ NO need for attribution - just provide the information directly
```

### Multi-Document Attribution Format:

**Template:**
```
According to the **[Document Name]**, [fact with **value**]. The **[Other Document]** shows [fact with **value**].
```

**Examples:**

**CORRECT (Multi-Document):**
```
✅ "According to the **Koda Business Plan**, the revenue projection for Year 1 is **$670,800**. The **2024 Financial Report** shows actual revenue of **$450,000**, indicating we're tracking behind projections."
```

**WRONG (No Attribution):**
```
❌ "The projected revenue is $670,800 and actual revenue is $450,000."
```
*Problem: Doesn't tell the user which number came from which document!*

**CORRECT (Single Document):**
```
✅ "The revenue projection for Year 1 is **$670,800**, with projected user count of **280 users**."
```
*Note: No need to repeat "According to the Business Plan" multiple times when all information is from the same document*

## FORMATTING ISSUES TO FIX

### Current Problem: Excessive Bold Usage

**Location:** `backend/src/services/rag.service.ts:1623, 1709-1718`

**Current Instruction (CAUSING PROBLEM):**
```
✅ **USE BOLD ONLY FOR VALUES** - Bold only numbers, dates, and key values
**BOLD FORMATTING** - Only bold the actual values/numbers themselves
```

**Result:** AI is bolding values throughout responses

**User Feedback:** "the ai is still using bold for answers is not good"

---

### Recommended Fix:

**Option 1: Remove All Bold Formatting**
```
✅ **FORMATTING** - Use plain text for all responses. Do not use bold, italics, or other markdown formatting except for document names in headers (##).
```

**Option 2: Minimal Bold (Headers Only)**
```
✅ **FORMATTING** - Use markdown formatting ONLY for:
- Document names as headers: ## [Document Name]
- Key Points section header: **Key Points:**
- Do NOT bold numbers, values, dates, or any other content
```

**Option 3: Bold for Document Names in Attribution Only**
```
✅ **FORMATTING** - Use plain text for all content. Only bold document names when attributing information from multiple sources (e.g., "According to the **Business Plan**...").
```
