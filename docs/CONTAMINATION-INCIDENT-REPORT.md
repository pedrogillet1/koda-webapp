**Incident Date:** October 8, 2025, 13:38-13:44 GMT-3
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Cross-user data contamination
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution Date:** October 8, 2025, 19:30 GMT-3

---

## Incident Timeline

### 13:38 - 13:44 (Oct 8, 2025)
- User uploaded multiple PDFs including "Koda Business Plan V12 (1).pdf" and "Comprovante1.pdf"
- Text extraction process contaminated the Business Plan document with receipt content
- Contaminated text stored in database `document_metadata.extractedText` field

### User Reports (Post-incident)
1. AI returning psychiatric content when asking about "Comprovante1.pdf"
2. AI finding 3 documents for "comprovante" query (should be 1)
3. Business Plan document showing receipt content in AI responses

### Investigation (Oct 8, 2025, 14:00-19:30)
1. Created diagnostic scripts to analyze contamination
2. Discovered contaminated text in database
3. Verified actual PDF files in GCS are clean and uncorrupted
4. Confirmed current pdf-parse extraction works correctly
5. Identified contamination only exists in database metadata

### Resolution (Oct 8, 2025, 19:30)
1. Created `fix-biz-plan-db.ts` script
2. Re-extracted text from actual PDF file
3. Updated database with clean extracted text
4. Verified fix successful

## Technical Details

### Affected Document
- **Filename:** Koda Business Plan V12 (1).pdf
- **Document ID:** df64c6f3-7cca-48bf-ab81-4b5fb3cfe232
- **User ID:** 03ec97ac-1934-4188-8471-524366d87521
- **File Size:** 865,262 bytes
- **File Hash:** 70c4d3fd23ad332e...

### Contamination Details

**Before Fix (Database):**
- Extracted text length: 43,451 characters
- Started with: "Recomendamos a impressão desse Comprovante..." (receipt content)
- Contained: Receipt content + Business plan content
- Status: ❌ CONTAMINATED

**After Fix (Database):**
- Extracted text length: 42,647 characters
- Starts with: "Business Plan June 2025 Confidential..."
- Contains: ONLY business plan content
- Status: ✅ CLEAN

**Actual PDF File (GCS):**
- Status: ✅ ALWAYS CLEAN (never corrupted)
- Current extraction: 42,262 characters of clean business plan content
- The file storage was NEVER the issue

### Root Cause Analysis

**What Happened:**
During the original document upload on Oct 8, 2025 (13:39), the PDF text extraction process somehow mixed content from multiple documents. The contaminated text was saved to the database's `document_metadata.extractedText` field.

**What Did NOT Happen:**
- ❌ File storage corruption (GCS files were always clean)
- ❌ pdf-parse library bug (current extraction works correctly)
- ❌ Import syntax issue (`.pdf` export is correct)
- ❌ Concurrent processing mixing buffers (files have different hashes)

**Most Likely Cause:**
The contamination occurred during a specific moment in time (Oct 8, 13:38-13:44) when multiple documents were being processed. The exact mechanism is unclear, but possibilities include:
1. Race condition in document processing queue
2. Memory buffer not being properly cleared between extractions
3. Temporary issue with pdf-parse state management
4. Database transaction issue during metadata save

**Why It Persisted:**
Once the contaminated text was saved to the database, it remained there because:
1. Document reprocessing doesn't happen automatically
2. The actual PDF file was clean, so downloads/previews worked fine
3. Only AI search queries exposed the contaminated database text

## Files Verified

### User's Documents (25 total)
Only 2 documents contain "comprovante":
1. ✅ **Comprovante1.pdf** (6,631 bytes, 803 chars) - CORRECT receipt document
2. ✅ **Koda Business Plan V12 (1).pdf** (865,262 bytes, 42,647 chars) - FIXED (no longer contaminated)

### File Integrity Check
All PDF files in GCS were verified:
- ✅ File hashes match database records
- ✅ File sizes match database records
- ✅ Files are NOT corrupted
- ✅ Current pdf-parse extraction works correctly

---

## Scripts Created for Investigation

1. **check-biz-plan-db.ts** - Check database state for Business Plan document
2. **test-pdf-extraction.ts** - Direct extraction test from GCS file
3. **show-my-docs.ts** - List all user documents with contamination markers
4. **check-file-hashes.ts** - Verify file integrity in GCS
5. **analyze-corrupted-doc.ts** - Deep analysis of contaminated document
6. **reprocess-contaminated-docs.ts** - Reprocess documents from contamination window
7. **fix-biz-plan-db.ts** - ✅ Final fix script that resolved the issue

## Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Diagnosis
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/check-biz-plan-db.ts
```
Confirmed database contains contaminated text (43,451 chars with receipt content)

### Step 2: Verify Actual File
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/test-pdf-extraction.ts
```
Confirmed actual PDF extracts cleanly (42,262 chars, ONLY business plan)

### Step 3: Fix Database
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/fix-biz-plan-db.ts
```
Re-extracted text from actual file and updated database

### Step 4: Verification
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/check-biz-plan-db.ts
```
Confirmed database now contains clean text (42,647 chars, NO receipt content)

## Impact Assessment

### Affected Users
- 1 user affected (User ID: 03ec97ac-1934-4188-8471-524366d87521)
- 1 document contaminated (out of 25 total user documents)

### Data Exposure
- ❌ NO cross-user file access occurred
- ❌ NO unauthorized file downloads
- ⚠️  Database metadata showed mixed content in AI search results
- The contamination was limited to text extraction metadata, NOT actual files

### User Experience Impact
- AI search results showed incorrect content
- User received confusing answers about document contents
- Download/preview functionality worked correctly (files were clean)

---

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
1. ✅ Fixed contaminated database entry
2. ✅ Verified all user documents
3. ✅ Confirmed file storage integrity

### Recommended Future Actions
1. **Add Document Processing Isolation**
   - Ensure each document extraction runs in isolated context
   - Clear all buffers/caches between extractions
   - Add extraction job ID tracking

2. **Add Extraction Verification**
   - Compare extracted text length with expected document size
   - Flag suspicious extractions (e.g., same text in different documents)
   - Add automated content contamination detection

3. **Add Database Integrity Checks**
   - Periodic script to verify extractedText matches actual file
   - Alert on anomalies (e.g., wrong content type in extraction)

4. **Add Processing Audit Trail**
   - Log extraction timestamps, worker IDs, memory state
   - Track concurrent extractions for forensics

5. **Consider Reprocessing Safety**
   - Add "reprocess document" endpoint for users
   - Automatic reprocessing on extraction anomalies

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Database is separate from file storage** - Contaminated metadata doesn't mean corrupted files
2. **Legacy data can persist** - Old buggy extractions remain until explicitly fixed
3. **File hashes are reliable** - Hash verification confirmed files were never corrupted
4. **Current code works correctly** - Re-extraction with current code produced clean results
5. **Need better monitoring** - Contamination detection should be automated

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

**Final Verification:**
```
Contains "comprovante": NO ✅
Contains psychiatric content: NO ✅
Contains business plan: YES ✅
Text length: 42,647 chars (clean)
```

The contamination incident has been successfully resolved. The database now contains correct, clean text extracted from the actual PDF file. User's AI search queries will now return accurate results.
