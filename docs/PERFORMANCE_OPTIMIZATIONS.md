- **File:** `backend/src/services/rag.service.ts`

### 2. Vector Search Optimization
**What Changed:**
- Reduced embedding search from 100 to 50 most recent chunks
- Reduced topK from 12 to 5 chunks for faster search
- Higher similarity threshold for better relevance

**Impact:**
- **Expected improvement:** 3-5s → 1-2s for vector search
- **File:** `backend/src/services/vectorEmbedding.service.ts`

### 3. System Prompt Optimization
**What Changed:**
- Reduced system prompt from ~800 tokens to ~50 tokens
- Removed verbose instructions, kept only critical rules

**Impact:**
- **Expected improvement:** 1-2s saved on LLM processing
- **File:** `backend/src/services/rag.service.ts` (line 734-742)

### 4. Fast Embedding Cache (Node-Cache)
**What Changed:**
- Added in-memory embedding cache using `node-cache`
- 2-tier caching: Memory (fast) → Redis (persistent)
- Cache TTL: 1 hour, max 1000 entries

**Impact:**
- **Expected improvement:** 500ms → <1ms for cached embeddings
- **Files:**
  - `backend/src/services/embeddingCache.service.ts` (new)
  - `backend/src/services/vectorEmbedding.service.ts` (updated)

### 5. Response Caching (Redis)
**What Changed:**
- Added Redis-based response caching for repeated queries
- Instant response (<100ms) for cache hits
- TTL: 1 hour per response

**Impact:**
- **Expected improvement:** Instant response for repeated queries
- **Cache hit rate target:** 30%+
- **Files:**
  - `backend/src/services/responseCache.service.ts` (new)
  - `backend/src/services/rag.service.ts` (updated)

## 🎯 Key Optimizations Summary

### What We Optimized
1. ✅ **Context Size:** 30k → 12k chars (60% reduction)
2. ✅ **Chunk Retrieval:** 100 → 50 embeddings (50% reduction)
3. ✅ **TopK Results:** 10 → 5 chunks (50% reduction)
4. ✅ **System Prompt:** 800 → 50 tokens (94% reduction)
5. ✅ **Embedding Cache:** Added 2-tier caching (Memory + Redis)
6. ✅ **Response Cache:** Added Redis caching for repeated queries

### What's Still Using Current Implementation
- ✅ **Streaming:** Already implemented in `sendMessageStreaming`
- ✅ **GPT-4o-mini:** Already using for RAG answers (line 710-778)
- ✅ **Semantic Cache:** Already implemented in chat service

## 🚀 Phase 2: Advanced Optimizations (Next Steps)

### 1. Pinecone Vector Database
**What:** Replace PostgreSQL pgvector with Pinecone
**Why:** Dedicated vector DB is 10x faster for similarity search
**Expected improvement:** 2-5s → 0.3-0.8s for vector search

### 2. Database Indexing
**What:** Add indexes for frequent queries
**SQL:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_user_id ON documents(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_document_chunks_document_id ON document_chunks(document_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_chat_messages_chat_id ON chat_messages(chat_id);
```
**Expected improvement:** 500ms → 200ms for DB queries

### 3. Query Classification
**What:** Classify queries to determine optimal retrieval strategy
**Categories:** summary, specific, comparison
**Expected improvement:** Better resource allocation per query type

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure average response time (should be 10-15s)
- [ ] Check cache hit rate after 100 queries (target: 30%+)
- [ ] Verify streaming works correctly
- [ ] Test with different document sizes (1 page vs 100 pages)
- [ ] Measure vector search time (should be 1-2s)

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Verify answers are still accurate
- [ ] Check source citations work correctly
- [ ] Test with Portuguese and English queries
- [ ] Verify Excel cell queries work
- [ ] Test with multiple documents

### Monitoring
- [ ] Track response times in logs
- [ ] Monitor cache hit rates
- [ ] Watch for errors in streaming
- [ ] Check Redis connection stability

## 🔍 Monitoring Commands

### Check Response Cache Stats
```typescript
import responseCacheService from './services/responseCache.service';
const stats = await responseCacheService.getStats();
console.log('Response cache:', stats);
```

### Check Embedding Cache Stats
```typescript
import embeddingCacheService from './services/embeddingCache.service';
const stats = embeddingCacheService.getStats();
console.log('Embedding cache:', stats);
```

### Clear Caches (if needed)
```typescript
await responseCacheService.clearAll();
embeddingCacheService.clear();
```

## 📝 Notes

### Current Performance Bottlenecks (Still Present)
1. **PostgreSQL Vector Search:** Still using pgvector (slow for large datasets)
   - Solution: Implement Pinecone in Phase 2
2. **No Connection Pooling Optimization:** Could improve DB query speed
   - Solution: Configure Prisma connection pooling

### Disabled Features (For Performance)
- ❌ Query Expansion (was adding 5-10s)
- ❌ Reranking (was adding 30+s)
- ❌ Fact Verification (was adding 15+s due to Anthropic API)

These were disabled because they caused significant delays. Can be re-enabled later if needed with optimization.

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Complete When:**
- ✅ Average response time < 15s
- ✅ Streaming works smoothly
- ✅ Cache hit rate > 30% after warmup
- ✅ No accuracy degradation
- ✅ All tests passing

**Ready for Production:**
- Average response time consistently 10-15s
- Cache hit rate stable at 30%+
- No streaming issues
- Proper error handling
- Monitoring in place

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

1. **Restart backend server** to load new services
2. **Redis must be running** for caching to work (optional but recommended)
3. **Test thoroughly** before pushing to production
4. **Monitor logs** for performance metrics
