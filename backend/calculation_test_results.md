#### ✅ Test 10: A price dropped from $80 to $60. What is the percentage decrease?

**Difficulty:** medium

**Expected Answer:**
`25%`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, let's calculate that percentage decrease. A price dropping from **$80** to **$60** represents a **25%** decrease. Here's how you figure that out: The difference between the original price and the new price is **$20** (**$80 - $60 = $20**). Then, you divide that difference by the original price (**$20 / $80 = 0.25**). Finally, you multiply by 100 to get the percentage (**0.25 * 100 = 25%**).

While the documents provided, specifically the "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx," don't directly address this specific calculation, they do contain various percentage calculations related to revenue, NOI, and other financial metrics, which shows that percentage calculations are relevant to the document's content.

#### ✅ Test 12: Calculate compound interest: $10,000 principal, 5% annual rate, 10 years

**Difficulty:** medium

**Expected Answer:**
`$16,288.95 (final amount) or $6,288.95 (interest)`

**Koda's Answer:**
Principal: $10,000.00
Annual Rate: 5%
Years: 10
Final Amount: $16,288.95
Interest Earned: $6,288.95

**How I calculated this**: **
The calculation uses the standard compound interest formula: `A = P * (1 + r)^t`, where `A` is the final amount, `P` is the principal, `r` is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), and `t` is the number of years.
First, the annual rate of 5% is converted to its decimal form, 0.05.
Then, the principal ($10,000) is multiplied by `(1 + 0.05)` raised to the power of 10 years to find the final amount.
Finally, the interest earned is calculated by subtracting the initial principal from the final amount. Both results are formatted as currency with two decimal places.

#### ✅ Test 18: What is the present value of $10,000 received in 5 years at 8% discount rate?

**Difficulty:** hard

**Expected Answer:**
`$6,805.83`

**Koda's Answer:**
The future value is: $10,000.00 The discount rate is: 8% The number of years is: 5 The Present Value of $10,000.00 received in 5 years at an 8% discount rate is: $6,805.83 **How I calculated this**: **
The calculation uses the `numpy_financial.pv` function to determine the present value of a single future amount.
• `rate`: The annual discount rate (8% converted to 0.08).
• `nper`: The total number of periods (5 years).
• `pmt`: The payment made each period. Since this is a single future amount and not an annuity, `pmt` is 0.
• `fv`: The future value, which is $10,000.
The `npf.pv` function returns a negative value by default, representing the initial investment (outflow) required to achieve the future value. To present the present value as a positive equivalent amount, the absolute value of the result is taken and then rounded to two decimal places. Executed Python code in 96ms

#### ✅ Test 20: What is the effective annual rate if nominal rate is 12% compounded monthly?

**Difficulty:** hard

**Expected Answer:**
`12.68%`

**Koda's Answer:**
The effective annual rate is: 12.68% **How I calculated this**: **
The effective annual rate (EAR) is calculated using the formula: `EAR = (1 + (nominal_rate / n)) ^ n - 1`, where `nominal_rate` is the stated annual interest rate and `n` is the number of compounding periods per year.
In this case, the nominal rate is 12% (0.12 as a decimal) and the compounding is monthly, so there are 12 compounding periods per year. The formula calculates the true annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compounding. The result is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage and rounded to two decimal places. Executed Python code in 25ms

#### ✅ Test 25: Calculate the range of: 15, 22, 8, 45, 33, 12

**Difficulty:** easy

**Expected Answer:**
`37`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, I can help you calculate the range of the numbers you provided: 15, 22, 8, 45, 33, 12. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a set of numbers. ## Calculating the Range To find the range, first identify the highest and lowest numbers in the set. In this case, the highest number is **45** and the lowest number is **8**. The range is then calculated by subtracting the lowest number from the highest number. So, the range is 45 - 8 = **37**. Therefore, the range of the numbers 15, 22, 8, 45, 33, and 12 is **37**. ## Document Analysis The provided documents, all titled "worldbank_EG.USE.ELEC.KH.PC.xlsx" and "worldbank_AG.LND.ARBL.ZS.xlsx", contain data related to electric power consumption (kWh per capita) and arable land (% of land area) for various countries. These documents do not contain the numbers you provided, so they are not directly relevant to calculating the range. However, I can illustrate how the range is useful in analyzing these datasets. For example, in Document 1 ("worldbank_AG.LND.ARBL.ZS.xlsx"), Row 151 shows the arable land data for Morocco. The data spans multiple years. If we wanted to know the range of arable land percentage for Morocco over the years provided, we would find the highest and lowest percentages and subtract. Similarly, Documents 2, 3, 4, and 5 ("worldbank_EG.USE.ELEC.KH.PC.xlsx") contain electric power consumption data. We can calculate the range for specific countries to see how much the power consumption varies.

### Growth & Rates (5/5 correct)

#### ✅ Test 26: Calculate CAGR: Starting value $1M, Ending value $2M, 5 years

**Difficulty:** hard

**Expected Answer:**
`14.87%`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, I can definitely help you calculate the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) based on the values you provided. The CAGR is approximately **14.87%**. I'll also show you how I calculated that, and provide some context using the documents you've provided. The formula for CAGR is: CAGR = [(Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of Years)] - 1. In your case: CAGR = [($2,000,000 / $1,000,000)^(1 / 5)] - 1 = **0.1487**, or **14.87%**. This means your investment grew at an average annual rate of 14.87% over the five-year period. Now, let's see if any of the provided documents offer further context on growth rates or investment performance. I will be looking for any indications of investment returns, profit margins, or related financial metrics that might be comparable to the CAGR we just calculated. While the documents don't directly give investment CAGR, "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" provides insights into potential investment performance through MoIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return) calculations, as well as some land values. The "MoICs into IRRs" sheet in "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" shows calculations for rough IRR based on MoIC. For example, Row 2 shows a MoIC Gross of 2.5 over 6 years. "Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2025 (Budget).xlsx" and "Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2024.xlsx" detail the projected and actual Profit and Loss statements for a ranch. While these don't directly relate to CAGR, they provide a financial overview, including revenue, expenses, and profit margins. The 2024 document shows a "Total Non-Operating Expense" of **$1,259,617.95**. The 2025 document is a budget, showing projected revenue streams such as "Room Revenue" (**$3,741,462.88**) and "Food Revenue" (**$5,786,758.16**). The document "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf" discusses stock recommendation schemes and portfolio allocation methods. Although it does not have specific numbers, it does mention using historical S&P 500 data from **1990** to **2017**, which is a good example of the kind of data used to analyze investment performance, although it doesn't give specific CAGR numbers. **Key Takeaway:** While none of the documents directly mention a CAGR of 14.87%, they provide related financial data and context that can be used to evaluate investment performance and profitability. The "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" is the closest to providing comparable metrics like IRR and MoIC, offering a way to benchmark the calculated CAGR.

#### ✅ Test 27: If a population grows at 3% annually, what will it be in 10 years starting from 100,000?

**Difficulty:** medium

**Expected Answer:**
`134,392`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, I can help you with that! If a population of **100,000** grows at **3%** annually, in **10 years** it will be approximately **134,392**. This is calculated using the formula for compound interest: Future Value = Present Value * (1 + growth rate)^number of years. The provided documents primarily concern "Early-demographic dividend" data from the World Bank and don't directly relate to population growth calculations. The files show values related to consumption in a country (identified by country code EAR) across various years such as **2003**, **2009**, **2010**, and **2023** (worldbank_EG.USE.PCAP.KG.OE.xlsx). These values represent consumption levels, not population numbers or growth rates. Therefore, while the documents don't contribute to the population growth calculation, they highlight economic data for a specific demographic dividend. Remember that population growth is a key factor in economic planning and resource allocation.

#### ✅ Test 28: Calculate year-over-year growth rate: Year 1: $500K, Year 2: $650K

**Difficulty:** easy

**Expected Answer:**
`30%`

**Koda's Answer:**
Year-over-Year Growth Rate: 30.00% **How I calculated this**: **
The year-over-year growth rate is calculated by taking the difference between the current year's value (Year 2) and the previous year's value (Year 1), dividing it by the previous year's value, and then multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage. In this case, (650,000 - 500,000) / 500,000 = 0.30, which is 30.00%. Executed Python code in 25ms

#### ✅ Test 29: If inflation is 4% per year, what will $100 be worth in 10 years (in today's dollars)?

**Difficulty:** hard

**Expected Answer:**
`$67.56`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, I can help you figure out the real value of $100 after 10 years of inflation at 4% per year. Essentially, we need to calculate the present value of that $100, discounting it back 10 years at the given inflation rate. Here's how you can calculate that: The formula for present value is: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where PV is the present value, FV is the future value ($100 in this case), r is the inflation rate (4% or 0.04), and n is the number of years (10). Plugging in the values, we get: PV = 100 / (1 + 0.04)^10 = 100 / (1.04)^10 ≈ **$67.56**. Therefore, if inflation runs at 4% per year, $100 in 10 years will have the purchasing power of about **$67.56** in today's dollars. This is because inflation erodes the value of money over time. While the provided documents don't directly address this calculation, they do touch on related financial concepts. For example, the "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" document discusses metrics like "MF on Equity" (Row 3), "MoIC NET" (Row 6), and "Branding Rate" (Row 70), all of which are related to investment performance and returns, which need to be considered *relative* to inflation to understand real gains. Also, "worldbank_BX.TRF.PWKR.DT.GD.ZS.xlsx" provides inflation data for different countries and income levels, which can be used for more specific calculations if you're interested in a particular region. For instance, in 2018, the inflation for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) was **3.859%** (Row 366). **Key Takeaway:** Understanding the impact of inflation is crucial for making informed financial decisions, whether it's related to investments, savings, or project valuations. While a nominal return might look appealing, the real return, adjusted for inflation, gives a clearer picture of actual purchasing power.

#### ✅ Test 30: Sales grew from $2M to $3.5M over 3 years. What is the average annual growth rate?

**Difficulty:** hard

**Expected Answer:**
`20.51%`

**Koda's Answer:**
Starting Sales: $2,000,000.00 Ending Sales: $3,500,000.00 Number of Years: 3 The average annual growth rate is: 20.51% **How I calculated this**: **
The problem asks for the average annual growth rate, which is equivalent to the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). The CAGR formula is used to calculate the geometric mean of a series of annual growth rates over a specified period. It is calculated as `((Ending Value / Starting Value) ^ (1 / Number of Years)) - 1`.
In this case, the starting sales are $2,000,000, the ending sales are $3,500,000, and the period is 3 years. These values are plugged into the formula, and the result is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage, rounded to two decimal places. Executed Python code in 92ms

#### ✅ Test 32: Calculate debt-to-equity ratio: Debt $500K, Equity $1M

**Difficulty:** easy

**Expected Answer:**
`0.5 or 1:2`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, I can help you calculate the debt-to-equity ratio based on the information you provided. Given a debt of **$500K** and equity of **$1M**, the debt-to-equity ratio is **0.5**. This is calculated by dividing the total debt by the total equity. ## Debt-to-Equity Ratio Calculation The debt-to-equity ratio is a financial metric that compares a company's total debt to its total equity. It's used to evaluate a company's financial leverage. A lower debt-to-equity ratio generally indicates a more financially stable company. In your case: * **Debt**: $500,000
* **Equity**: $1,000,000 Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity = $500,000 / $1,000,000 = **0.5** ## Context from "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" Let's examine some debt and equity figures within the provided document, "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" (4 pages), to see how they relate to real-world examples. Keep in mind the document presents various scenarios, so these are not directly comparable to your specific calculation, but are shown to provide general understanding of the document. * **Document 2, Row 45**: Shows a "Debt" value of **$30**, **$189**, **$219**, and **$441** in various scenarios.
* **Document 2, Row 46**: Shows corresponding "Equity" values of **$40**, **$95**, **$145**, and **$148** in the same scenarios.
* **Document 4, Row 34**: Shows "Debt Land" as **$30**, with a corresponding negative value of **($30)**, suggesting an initial investment and subsequent deduction.
* **Document 4, Row 41**: Shows "Equity FUND" values of **$120**, **$31**, **$20**, **$35**, **$206**, and **$148** across different investment scenarios.
* **Document 1, Row 54**: Lists "Equity FUND" values of **$120**, **$307**, **$31**, **$20**, **$35**, **$206**, and **$148**. These figures from "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" represent different investment allocations and project scenarios, each with its own debt and equity structure. The debt-to-equity ratio would vary significantly across these examples depending on the specific investment strategy and the stage of the project. ## Implications of the Debt-to-Equity Ratio A debt-to-equity ratio of **0.5** indicates that for every dollar of equity, the company has 50 cents of debt. This is generally considered a healthy balance. It implies that the company is not overly reliant on debt financing. However, what is considered an "ideal" ratio can vary greatly by industry. Capital-intensive industries may have higher ratios, while service-based industries may have lower ones. It’s crucial to compare this ratio to industry benchmarks and the company's historical performance to get a comprehensive understanding of its financial health. **Key Takeaway:** A debt-to-equity ratio of **0.5**, based on your provided figures, suggests a balanced capital structure. Remember to compare this ratio to industry standards and historical trends for a more complete assessment.

#### ✅ Test 33: What is the price-to-earnings ratio if stock price is $50 and EPS is $5?

**Difficulty:** easy

**Expected Answer:**
`10`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, I can help you calculate the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Given a stock price of **$50** and earnings per share (EPS) of **$5**, the P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by the EPS. So, **$50 / $5 = 10**. Therefore, the P/E ratio is **10**. The documents you provided contain information about financial ratios, including P/E and EPS. Document 2, titled "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf", lists **Price to earnings (P/E) ratio** and **Earnings per share (EPS)** as key financial indicators used in stock analysis. Document 3 shows their relative "importance" using Random Forest analysis. The P/E ratio indicates overall profitability, stability, operating efficiency, capital structure, and the ability to generate future cash flows for companies, reflecting the intrinsic value of a company. **For Strategy:**
• Use P/E ratio as one of the key indicators to evaluate the financial health of a company, as suggested in the document "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf".
• Combine P/E ratio with other financial ratios like price-to-sales (P/S) ratio and price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio for a comprehensive stock ranking strategy. **For Risk Management:**
• Consider using machine learning algorithms to dynamically assign weights to different financial ratios, including P/E, to reduce subjectivity and increase the security of financial investments.
• Implement risk management strategies, such as minimizing variance and maximizing Sharpe ratio, in portfolio allocation methodologies. **Bottom line:** With a stock price of $50 and EPS of $5, the P/E ratio is 10. Use this ratio with other financial indicators and consider machine learning for dynamic weighting to improve stock selection and risk management.

#### ✅ Test 35: Divide $10,000 in the ratio 2:3:5. What are the three amounts?

**Difficulty:** medium

**Expected Answer:**
`$2,000, $3,000, $5,000`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, I can help you divide **$10,000** in the ratio **2:3:5**. The three amounts are calculated as follows: * First amount: (**2**/10) \* **$10,000** = **$2,000**
• Second amount: (**3**/10) \* **$10,000** = **$3,000**
• Third amount: (**5**/10) \* **$10,000** = **$5,000** So the **$10,000** is divided into **$2,000**, **$3,000**, and **$5,000**. I've reviewed the documents you provided, which include several financial spreadsheets. The document, **Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx**, contains financial data, but it doesn't directly address ratio calculations or allocation problems like the one you presented. Instead, it focuses on aspects of a fund's performance, such as equity, debt, and profit distribution. The **Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx** document has multiple sheets, but they don't provide any calculations relevant to your specific question about dividing **$10,000** in a **2:3:5** ratio. For example, on one of the sheets, the document shows "Equity FUND" calculations in rows **54-57**, including values for "MF on Equity Fund" and "PIF on Equity Fund", but nothing related to ratio-based divisions. The **Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx** document consists of 5 pages. The other two documents, **Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2024.xlsx** and **Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2025 (Budget).xlsx**, are Profit and Loss statements for a ranch. While these documents contain numerous financial figures, they similarly do not relate to the specific mathematical problem you posed. These documents contain a variety of revenue and expense categories, such as "Site Fee - Wedding" and "Package Breakage: Activities Gross Allocation." While the documents don't directly answer your question, they do highlight the importance of understanding financial ratios and allocations in real-world scenarios. The ability to divide funds according to a specific ratio is a fundamental skill in financial management, investment, and budgeting, all of which are reflected in the documents you provided. The calculations in the documents require a strong foundation in mathematical concepts like ratios, percentages, and allocations.

### Complex Multi-Step (2/5 correct)

#### ⚠️ Test 41: A company has $1M revenue, 40% gross margin, and $200K operating expenses. What is the net income?

**Difficulty:** hard

**Expected Answer:**
`$200,000`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, I can help you calculate the net income. With **$1M** in revenue, a **40%** gross margin, and **$200K** in operating expenses, the net income is **$200K**. Here's the breakdown: A **40%** gross margin on **$1M** revenue is **$400K** (**$1,000,000 * 0.40 = $400,000**). Subtracting the **$200K** in operating expenses from the **$400K** gross profit leaves you with **$200K** in net income. This means the company is profitable, but operating expenses are taking up half of the gross profit. For comparison, let's look at some expense data from the "Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2025 (Budget).xlsx" document. The total Undistributed Operating Expenses are budgeted at **$4,720,087.22** (Row 44). The Income Before Non-Operating Expenses is **$605,694** (Row 47), significantly higher than your example, indicating a more profitable operation based on the projected budget.

#### ⚠️ Test 43: If you invest $1,000 monthly at 8% annual return for 30 years, what will you have?

**Difficulty:** hard

**Expected Answer:**
`$1,490,359`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, I can help you figure out the future value of your investment! Based on a standard compound interest calculation, if you invest **$1,000** monthly at an **8%** annual return for **30 years**, you would accumulate approximately **$1,362,462.26**. This assumes the interest is compounded monthly. Now, let's dive into what the provided documents offer and how they relate to investment strategies and returns, even though they don't directly calculate this specific scenario. ## Rosewood Fund Analysis The **Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx** document provides insights into fund performance metrics and financial modeling. Across its multiple pages, it details various aspects such as equity contributions, debt, and other financial sources. For example, one section of the document shows calculations related to "Equity FUND" and "Equity FUND NET" (Row 54 and 57), with values like **$120** and **$268** reported. There are also calculations of "MF on Equity Fund" and "PIF on Equity Fund", which seem to represent management fees and performance incentive fees (Rows 55 and 56). These entries highlight the costs associated with actively managed funds, which can impact overall returns compared to a simple, consistent investment strategy like the one you described. The document also includes metrics like "MoIC NET" (Multiple on Invested Capital), indicating the return on investment relative to the initial capital (Row 6). ## Unicorn Edge Strategy The two copies of the document titled **2511.12490v1_Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor Drift Regimes.pdf** describe a trading strategy called "Unicorn Edge." This strategy boasts impressive out-of-sample performance, far exceeding typical factor performance. Table 2 highlights that the Unicorn Edge strategy achieved a Sharpe Ratio of **13.19** compared to the S&P 500 EW benchmark's **0.99**. This is a key metric in finance, measuring risk-adjusted return, where higher is better. The document states "Total OOS Return (3 test years)" for Unicorn Edge as **+10,938%** versus **+478%** for the S&P 500. However, it is important to note that this performance was achieved during specific test windows (2010-2011, 2015-2016, 2020-2021) which coincided with exceptionally strong post-crisis and post-COVID bull-market regimes. Table 3 shows how an initial investment of **$1M** in Unicorn Edge would have grown to **$110,376,000** by 2021, vastly outperforming the benchmark. ## Key Takeaways While the Rosewood Fund document focuses on fund management metrics and the Unicorn Edge strategy highlights the potential for high returns using advanced trading techniques, neither directly calculates the future value of a simple, consistent monthly investment. The initial calculation of **$1,362,462.26** provides a baseline expectation based on your stated parameters. The returns demonstrated in the "Unicorn Edge" strategy are not typical and should not be expected. The Rosewood Fund document highlights the impact of management fees and performance fees.

#### ✅ Test 44: Company A has 60% market share, Company B has 25%. If total market is $10M, how much more does A earn than B?

**Difficulty:** medium

**Expected Answer:**
`$3.5M`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, let's break down how much more Company A earns than Company B, given the market share and total market size. With Company A holding **60%** and Company B holding **25%** of a **$10 million** market, we can calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference. This is a straightforward calculation, but let's ensure we provide a clear and helpful explanation. Company A earns **$6 million** (**60%** of **$10 million**), while Company B earns **$2.5 million** (**25%** of **$10 million**). Therefore, Company A earns **$3.5 million** more than Company B (**$6 million** - **$2.5 million**). This provides a clear picture of the earnings disparity between the two companies based on their market share. Here's a structured breakdown with some practical implications based on the provided documents. While the documents don't directly address market share calculations, they offer insights into competitive strategies and risk management that can be applied to improve market position. ## Practical Implications **For Strategy:** * **Differentiate to Gain Competitive Edge:** As highlighted in "2511.13614v1_Market-Dependent Communication in Multi-Agent Alph.pdf", agents in competitive environments often seek to differentiate their strategies. * Identify unique selling points or market niches to set your company apart. * Innovate in product offerings, customer service, or marketing to attract more customers.
* **Focus on High-Growth Opportunities:** The agents in the document emphasize the importance of focusing on momentum and high-growth stocks. While this example is from a financial context, it illustrates the need to identify and capitalize on high-growth market segments. * Allocate more resources to areas with the highest potential for growth. * Monitor market trends and adapt your strategy to capture emerging opportunities.
* **Balance Growth with Stability:** While pursuing high-growth opportunities, it's also important to consider stability and risk management. * Diversify your product or service offerings to reduce reliance on a single market segment. * Implement robust risk management practices to protect against market volatility. **For Risk Management:** * **Dynamic Risk Management:** The document mentions incorporating dynamic stop-loss strategies based on signal volatility. * Continuously assess market conditions and adjust your risk management strategies accordingly. * Implement flexible strategies that can adapt to changing market dynamics.
* **Adaptive Weighting:** Consider using a weighted approach to combine different market signals or strategies. * Assign higher weights to strategies that are performing well and lower weights to those that are underperforming. * Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of your strategies and adjust the weights accordingly. **Bottom line:** To increase earnings, Company B should focus on strategies to **differentiate** itself, potentially through innovative offerings or niche markets, while balancing growth with prudent risk management. Gaining even a small percentage of market share from Company A could significantly increase Company B's earnings.

#### ✅ Test 45: Calculate profit margin: Revenue $2M, COGS $1.2M, Operating expenses $400K, Tax rate 25%

**Difficulty:** hard

**Expected Answer:**
`15% (Net profit $300K)`

**Koda's Answer:**
Revenue: $2,000,000.00 Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $1,200,000.00 Gross Profit: $800,000.00 Operating Expenses: $400,000.00 Operating Profit (EBIT): $400,000.00 Tax Rate: 25% Tax Amount: $100,000.00 Net Profit After Tax: $300,000.00 The calculated Profit Margin is: 15.00% **How I calculated this**: **
The profit margin calculation involves several steps. First, Gross Profit is determined by subtracting the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) from Revenue. Next, Operating Profit (EBIT) is calculated by subtracting Operating Expenses from Gross Profit. The tax amount is then computed by applying the given tax rate to the Operating Profit. Finally, Net Profit After Tax is found by subtracting the tax amount from the Operating Profit. The Profit Margin is then calculated as the Net Profit After Tax divided by the Revenue, expressed as a percentage. All intermediate and final results are formatted for clarity, with currency values rounded to two decimal places and percentages displayed with a '%' sign. Executed Python code in 21ms

#### ✅ Test 47: What is the Customer Acquisition Cost if marketing spend is $50K and you acquired 500 customers?

**Difficulty:** easy

**Expected Answer:**
`$100`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, I can help you calculate the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC). Based on the information you provided, with a marketing spend of **$50,000** and **500** new customers acquired, the CAC would be **$100**. This is calculated by dividing the total marketing spend by the number of customers acquired (**$50,000 / 500 = $100**). So, it cost you **$100** in marketing expenses to acquire each new customer. While the provided documents ("Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2024.xlsx", "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx", and "Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2025 (Budget).xlsx") don't directly give us these figures, they do contain marketing and advertising expense information. For example, "Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2024.xlsx" includes details on digital advertising (**$85,693.02** total in Row 571) and non-digital advertising (**$21,952.57** total in Row 572). This shows where marketing dollars are being spent, but to calculate CAC, you'd still need the number of customers acquired from those specific campaigns.

#### ✅ Test 50: Calculate payback period: Initial investment $100K, Annual cash flow $25K

**Difficulty:** medium

**Expected Answer:**
`4 years`

**Koda's Answer:**
Okay, I can help you calculate the payback period based on the information you provided. With an initial investment of **$100,000** and an annual cash flow of **$25,000**, the payback period is **4 years**. This is calculated by dividing the initial investment by the annual cash flow (**$100,000 / $25,000 = 4**). ## Payback Period Calculation The payback period is a straightforward capital budgeting method used to determine the amount of time it takes for an investment to generate enough cash flow to cover its initial cost. It's a simple measure of how quickly an investment will "pay for itself." In this scenario, it will take **4 years** for the investment to generate **$100,000** in cash flow, recouping the initial investment. It's worth noting that the payback period doesn't consider the time value of money or any cash flows that occur after the payback period. This means that while it's easy to calculate and understand, it might not be the most comprehensive method for evaluating an investment's profitability. Other methods, like Net Present Value (NPV) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR), are often used in conjunction with the payback period to provide a more complete picture. Looking at the "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" document, there are several instances where financial metrics are calculated, although a direct payback period calculation isn't explicitly present. For example, on Sheet 2, "MoICs into IRRs," the document explores the relationship between the Multiple on Invested Capital (**MoIC**) and the Internal Rate of Return (**IRR**) over different durations. While not directly related to payback period, it shows an emphasis on understanding investment returns over time. The document "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" provides various financial analyses and projections. These analyses include projected cash flows, profitability metrics, and investment returns. While the document doesn't explicitly calculate a payback period, the data available could be used to perform such a calculation for the fund's investments. The document "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf" focuses on stock recommendation schemes and portfolio allocation, using machine learning techniques. It does not contain information about payback period calculations. **Key Takeaways:** The payback period for your investment is **4 years**. While easy to calculate, remember it has limitations. It is recommended to consider other financial metrics for a complete investment evaluation.
