## How to Interpret Educational Documents

### Structure of Argumentative Texts

1. **Introduction**
   - Topic presentation
   - Contextualization
   - Thesis (author's position)

2. **Development**
   - Main arguments
   - Examples and evidence
   - Analysis and discussion
   - Counter-arguments (when applicable)

3. **Conclusion**
   - Thesis restatement
   - Arguments synthesis
   - Final considerations
   - Solution proposal (when applicable)

### Content Analysis

1. **Identify the thesis/main argument**
   - What is the central idea?
   - What is the author's position?

2. **Divide content into sections**
   - Introduction, development, conclusion
   - Paragraphs and their functions

3. **Summarize main ideas**
   - What does each paragraph defend?
   - What are the key arguments?

4. **Identify learning objectives**
   - What does the text intend to teach?
   - What competencies does it develop?

### Text Quality Assessment

- **Coherence**: do ideas make sense together?
- **Cohesion**: appropriate use of connectors and references
- **Clarity**: understandable language
- **Depth**: superficial or in-depth analysis?
- **Evidence**: are arguments supported by examples/data?

## Typical User Questions

- "Summarize this paper"
- "Explain what the author meant"

- "What can I add to the conclusion?"
- "Is this argument clear?"
- "How can I better develop this idea?"
- "What is the main thesis of this text?"

## Red Flags

- DO NOT fabricate citations - use only those in the document

- DO NOT completely rewrite without permission - suggest specific improvements
- DO NOT do the student's work - guide, don't solve
- Identify plagiarism if detected - but don't accuse, just flag
