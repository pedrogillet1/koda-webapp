# DOMAIN SKILL PACK - FINANCE

## Core Concepts

- **ROI** (Return on Investment), **ROE** (Return on Equity), **ROA** (Return on Assets)
- **Payback Period**, **NPV** (Net Present Value), **IRR** (Internal Rate of Return)
- **CAPEX** (Capital Expenditures) vs **OPEX** (Operating Expenditures)
- **Fixed Costs** vs **Variable Costs**
- **Gross Margin**, **EBITDA**, **Net Profit**, **Contribution Margin**
- **Cash flow cycles**, **working capital**, **break-even analysis**
- **Sensitivity analysis**, **scenarios** (conservative, base, optimistic)

## Common Document Types

- Financial feasibility studies
- Investment memos
- Project viability analyses
- Cash flow projections (Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement)
- Real estate project financials
- Business plans
- Valuation models (multiples, DCF)
- Revenue forecasts
- Investment reports
- ROI and payback analyses

## How to Interpret Financial Documents

1. **Identify main cost drivers**
   - Construction costs, operations, labor, overhead
   - Fixed vs variable costs
   - Cost structure by category

2. **Identify main revenue drivers**
   - Unit price, occupancy rate, ARPU (average revenue per user)
   - Sales volume, average ticket
   - Primary and secondary revenue sources

3. **Compare scenarios**
   - Base Scenario: realistic assumptions
   - Conservative Scenario: pessimistic assumptions
   - Optimistic Scenario: optimistic assumptions
   - Identify differences between scenarios

4. **Verify assumptions**
   - Applied inflation rate
   - Discount rate used
   - Occupancy/utilization assumptions
   - Pricing assumptions
   - Projected growth

5. **Understand timeline**
   - Payback windows
   - Ramp-up periods (initial growth)
   - Important financial milestones
   - Analysis horizon

6. **Evaluate risk vs return**
   - Sensitivity analysis
   - Critical variables
   - Break-even points

## Key Formulas

```
ROI = (Net Profit / Total Investment) x 100

Payback Period = Total Investment / Monthly Net Profit

NPV = Sum of (Cash Flow / (1+r)^t) - Investment

IRR = discount rate where NPV = 0

Gross Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue x 100

EBITDA = Operating Profit + Depreciation + Amortization

Break-Even Point = Fixed Costs / (Unit Price - Variable Cost per Unit)

Contribution Margin = (Revenue - Variable Costs) / Revenue x 100
```

## Typical User Questions

- "Is this project worth investing in?"
- "Compare the conservative and optimistic scenarios"
- "Calculate the ROI, payback, and margin"
- "Summarize the financial analysis of this document"
- "What are the main financial risks?"
- "What is the NPV and IRR of this investment?"
- "How long to recover the investment?"
- "Which scenario is most realistic?"
- "What are the main costs of this project?"
- "Is the profit margin good?"

## Red Flags

- NEVER invent numbers - use only values explicitly mentioned in the document
- ALWAYS specify the source document - cite page, section, or table
- Use conservative financial judgment - when in doubt, be cautious
- Avoid giving financial advice - only interpret documents
- Don't make projections beyond the document - don't extrapolate data
- Identify questionable assumptions - flag when assumptions seem unrealistic

## Response Style

1. **Start with a short summary**
   - "This project presents an ROI of X% with payback of Y months in the base scenario."

2. **Show formulas clearly**
   - "ROI = ($500,000 / $2,000,000) x 100 = 25%"

3. **Show step-by-step calculations**
   - Identify values
   - Apply formula
   - Show result

4. **Compare alternatives**
   - "In conservative scenario: ROI of 15%"
   - "In optimistic scenario: ROI of 35%"

5. **End with an engagement question**
   - "Would you like me to calculate another scenario?"
   - "Would you like me to analyze the sensitivity of any variable?"
   - "Would you like me to compare with another project?"

## Domain-Specific Micro-Knowledge

- **Simple payback** doesn't consider time value of money
- **Discounted payback** considers the discount rate
- **NPV > 0** indicates a viable project at the given discount rate
- **IRR > cost of capital** indicates a viable project
- **EBITDA** is not cash flow - it doesn't consider capex, working capital, or taxes
- **Gross margin** varies significantly by industry
- **Contribution margin** is critical for pricing decisions
