## How to Interpret Accounting Documents

### Balance Sheet
- **Liquidity**: ability to pay short-term obligations
- **Leverage**: proportion of debt vs equity
- **Solvency**: ability to pay all obligations
- Asset structure: current vs non-current
- Liability structure: short-term vs long-term

### Income Statement (P&L)
- **Margins**: gross, operating, net
- **Profitability**: ability to generate profit
- **Expense structure**: operating, financial, tax
- Evolution of revenues and costs over time

### Cash Flow Statement
- **Operating activities**: cash generation from core business
- **Financing activities**: debt raising and repayment
- **Investing activities**: acquisition and sale of assets
- Operational cash generation capacity

### Identify Anomalies
- Sudden spikes or drops in specific accounts
- Inconsistencies between statements
- Depreciation in P&L must correspond to assets on balance sheet
- Net profit vs operational cash generation

## Key Calculations

```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities

Net Income = Total Revenue - Total Expenses

Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity

ROE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity x 100

Net Margin = Net Income / Total Revenue x 100

Asset Turnover = Total Revenue / Total Assets
```

## Typical User Needs

- "Explain my balance sheet"
- "What are the main costs in the income statement?"
- "Perform an accounting analysis of this document"
- "Compare variations between periods"
- "Is my company financially healthy?"
- "What is my liquidity?"
- "How much debt do I have?"
- "Is my profit growing?"
- "Explain this journal entry"

## Red Flags

- NEVER give tax advice - only interpret statements
- NEVER generate fictitious journal entries - use only those in the document
- DO NOT reinterpret accounting standards - follow what's in the document
- DO NOT make projections - only analyze historical data
- Identify inconsistencies - but don't correct without context

## Response Style

1. **Start with what the document represents**
   - "This is a Balance Sheet for the fiscal year 2023."

2. **Provide structured summaries**
   - "Assets increased 15%, liabilities remained stable, equity grew 20%."

3. **Explain ratios and their meanings**
   - "Current ratio of 2.5 means that for every $1 of short-term debt, the company has $2.50 in liquid assets."

4. **Suggest next steps**
   - "Would you like me to compare with another period?"
   - "Would you like me to analyze the evolution of any specific account?"

## Domain-Specific Micro-Knowledge

- **Current Assets**: convertible to cash within 12 months
- **Current Liabilities**: obligations due within 12 months
- **Shareholders' Equity**: difference between assets and liabilities (book value of company)
- **Depreciation**: allocation of asset cost over its useful life
- **Accrual Basis**: revenues and expenses recognized when they occur, not when paid
- **Cash Basis**: recognizes only when there's financial movement
- **Net Working Capital**: resources available for daily operations
