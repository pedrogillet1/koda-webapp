### Q5: Data Extraction (Easy)

**Question**: How many properties are included in the Rosewood Fund portfolio?

**Score**: 1.4/5 ❌

**Response Time**: 7904ms

**Issues**:
- Only 2/7 keywords found

**Koda's Response**:
```
The provided documents contain information related to the Rosewood Fund and portfolio management strategies, but they don't explicitly state the exact number of properties included in the Rosewood Fund portfolio. We can, however, infer some context from the data provided. The "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" documents (both with the same document ID) contain financial data related to different equity funds and their performance. They detail metrics like distribution totals, management fees, and performance incentive fees, but do not list individual properties. The other documents, "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf" and "2511.12490v1_Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor Drift Regimes.pdf", discuss portfolio allocation, risk management, and stock selection strategies using machine learning, but are not specific to the Rosewood Fund's holdings. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the number of properties in the Rosewood Fund portfolio is not explicitly stated. Here are some practical implications and guidance based on the documents: **For Portfolio Allocation:** * **Diversify using mean-variance and min-variance methods:** Document 4 ("2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf") mentions using mean-variance and minimum-variance optimization to allocate stocks. This helps balance risk and return by modeling individual asset weights.
* **Set position size limits:** Document 2 ("2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf") suggests limiting position sizes to a maximum of **5%** of portfolio value to control risk.
* **Consider equal-weighted portfolios as a benchmark:** Document 2 ("2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf") uses an equally weighted portfolio as a benchmark to compare performance. **For Risk Management:** * **Implement volatility and drawdown controls:** Document 5 ("2511.12490v1_Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor Drift Regimes.pdf") suggests using a scaling factor to satisfy a **12%** annual volatility cap and a **15%** maximum drawdown constraint.
* **Use a dynamic kill-switch:** Document 5 ("2511.12490v1_Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor Drift Regimes.pdf") recommends shutting down the strategy if losses exceed historical norms, such as a **30%** drawdown from peak or a **-10%** rolling **63**-day performance.
* **Account for transaction costs:** Document 2 ("2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf") considers transaction costs to be **1/1000** (0.1%) of the trade value. Document 5 ("2511.12490v1_Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor Drift Regimes.pdf") cites **0.6** basis points per unit traded. **For Trading:** * **Calculate transaction costs:** Use the formula provided in Document 2 ("2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf") to calculate transaction costs: n Σ i=1 |St, i − St−1, i| · Pi × 0.1%, where St, i is the shares to buy or sell at time t, St−1, i is the shares left at time t-1, and Pi is the current stock price of stock i. **Bottom line:** While the exact number of properties in the Rosewood Fund is not specified, the documents provide valuable insights into portfolio allocation and risk management techniques. Focus on diversification, setting position limits, controlling volatility, and accounting for transaction costs to optimize portfolio performance and manage risk effectively.

### Q6: Formula Understanding (Medium)

**Question**: How is the MoIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) calculated in the Rosewood Fund file?

**Score**: 2.1/5 ❌

**Response Time**: 7490ms

**Issues**:
- Only 3/7 keywords found

**Koda's Response**:
```
Okay, I can help you understand how MoIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) is calculated in the context of the "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" file. Based on the provided information, there appear to be a couple of ways MoIC is presented or calculated, and I'll break them down. ## Understanding MoIC in the Rosewood Fund The "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" file (5 pages) uses MoIC as a metric to represent the return on invested capital. Specifically, it seems to focus on both **Gross MoIC** and **Net MoIC**. Let's examine the sections of the document that provide insight into how these are derived. From the first document, "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx", we can see a few key rows related to MoIC: * **Row 6:** "MoIC NET" is listed as **2.43**. This row also shows "NET CF" (Net Cash Flow) as "2.43x" and "16.3%". It also contains a series of cash flows represented as "(1)", "(0)", and "3", leading to a final value of "1.51". It seems the Net MoIC is linked to the Net Cash Flow multiple.
* **Row 7:** "MoIC NET simple formula" shows a value of **2.51**. This suggests there might be a simplified calculation for Net MoIC.
* **Row 2 (Sheet 2: MoICs into IRRs):** "MoIC Gross" is shown as **2.5**. ## Calculations and Formulas The document doesn't explicitly lay out a single, definitive formula for MoIC. However, by examining the provided data, we can infer the general approach. * **MoIC (General):** The basic principle of MoIC is calculated as: (Total Distributions + Remaining Value) / Total Invested Capital. A MoIC of 2.0x means you've received back twice your initial investment.
* **MoIC NET:** "MoIC NET" (2.43) is likely calculated by considering the net cash flows after management fees (MF) and possibly carried interest (PIF). Row 8 suggests that distributions are netted of management fees, and PIF is calculated on distributions net of MFs over equity plus MFs paid.
* **MoIC NET Simple Formula:** The "MoIC NET simple formula" (2.51) might be a more straightforward calculation that doesn't account for the nuances of fees and carried interest, providing a slightly different perspective.
* **MoIC Gross:** "MoIC Gross" (2.5) represents the multiple before deducting management fees and carried interest. ## Key Takeaways Here are the key takeaways regarding MoIC within the "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" file: * The document uses both Gross and Net MoIC to assess investment performance.
• Net MoIC (2.43 or 2.51) reflects returns after deducting fees and carried interest.
• Gross MoIC (2.5) represents the return before these deductions.
• The "MoIC NET simple formula" suggests a simplified calculation method exists, potentially for quick estimations. Without the full context of the spreadsheet and its calculations, it's difficult to provide the *exact* formulas used. However, analyzing the cash flows and related metrics provides a solid understanding of how MoIC is being utilized in this fund's reporting.

### Q7: Formula Understanding (Medium)

**Question**: How does the Rosewood Fund file calculate the total investment across all properties?

**Score**: 2.1/5 ❌

**Response Time**: 7813ms

**Issues**:
- Only 3/7 keywords found

**Koda's Response**:
```
Okay, I'll explain how the Rosewood Fund file calculates the total investment across all properties based on the provided documents. It appears the calculation involves summing different sources of funding, including debt, equity, and other sources, for each property and then aggregating those totals. Let's break down the specifics. The primary document here is the "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx". There are multiple pages of this document, so I'll refer to specific rows to clarify the calculations. The other document, "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic," provides a different perspective, discussing portfolio allocation and risk management but doesn't directly contribute to understanding the investment calculation in the Rosewood Fund. The "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" document (all pages) shows a breakdown of investment sources for various properties. The total investment is calculated by summing the contributions from debt, equity, and other sources. Row **44** and Row **48** (which appear to be duplicates) in the document are labeled "Sources Total". These rows represent the sum of the individual funding sources for each property. For example, looking at Row **44**, the "Sources Total" is derived by adding the "Debt," "Equity," and "Other" contributions listed in the rows below (**Rows 45, 46, and 47**, respectively). The document then shows resulting metrics like "LTC" (Loan to Cost) and profitability measures based on these investments. The document also shows "Equity FUND" and "Equity FUND NET" values in Rows **54** and **57**, respectively. These values relate to equity investments specifically and factor into the overall investment picture. **Practical Implications:** Based on the document analysis, here's some actionable guidance for understanding and managing the Rosewood Fund's investments: * **For Investment Strategy:** * **Focus on Source Allocation:** Analyze the "Sources Total" (Rows **44** and **48**) to understand the mix of debt, equity, and other funding sources for each property. * **Monitor LTC:** Pay close attention to the "LTC" (Loan to Cost) ratio (Row **49**) to assess the leverage used for each property. Higher LTC ratios indicate greater reliance on debt financing. * **Track Profitability:** Regularly review the "Profit Total" (Row **50**) and "Distribution Total" (Rows **51** and **58**) to gauge the performance of each property and the overall fund. * **Evaluate Equity Performance:** Analyze the "Equity FUND" and "Equity FUND NET" (Rows **54** and **57**) to understand the returns generated from equity investments. * **For Risk Management:** * **Diversify Funding Sources:** Aim for a balanced mix of debt and equity financing to mitigate risk. Avoid over-reliance on any single funding source. * **Manage Leverage:** Keep the LTC ratio within acceptable limits to avoid excessive debt burden. * **Monitor Investment Life:** Track the "Life" of each investment (Row **59**) to ensure timely returns and manage potential risks associated with long-term investments. * **For Financial Modeling:** * **Use the formulas provided for**: * buy or sell share based on the portfolio weights at current time t and St−1, i is the shares left at previous time t − 1 (Unknown) * our transaction cost to be 1/1000 of the value of that trade (Unknown) * an investment strategy because its balance risk and return by modeling individual asset’s weights (Unknown) **Bottom line:** The Rosewood Fund calculates the total investment by summing the contributions from various funding sources (debt, equity, and other) for each property. Analyzing these funding sources, along with metrics like LTC, profitability, and equity performance, is crucial for understanding the fund's investment strategy and managing risk effectively.

### Q8: Formula Understanding (Easy)

**Question**: In the P&L files, how are subtotals calculated? For example, how is cell B71 calculated?

**Score**: 2.5/5 ❌

**Response Time**: 9441ms

**Koda's Response**:
```
Okay, I can help you understand how subtotals are calculated in the Lone Mountain Ranch P&L files, specifically focusing on cell B71. Based on the provided document snippets, it's challenging to give a definitive answer without knowing the exact structure of the Excel file. The documents only provide snippets of data, not the underlying formulas. However, I can infer how these subtotals are likely calculated based on typical P&L structures. ## Understanding P&L Subtotal Calculations In Profit & Loss statements, subtotals are generally derived by summing up the values of several line items above them. These line items represent either revenue or expense categories. In the context of the "Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2025 (Budget).xlsx" file, cell B71 likely represents a subtotal for a specific category of revenue or expenses for the month ending **01/31/2025**, based on the "Budget." Given the surrounding rows in the document, let's explore some likely calculation scenarios: * **Scenario 1: Sum of Room Revenue Subcategories:** If row 71 falls under the "Rooms" section (rows 64-68), cell B71 might be the sum of various room revenue streams. For example, it could be the sum of "440000 - Room Revenue" (B66), "440010 - Rooms - BnB" (B67), and "440020 - Room Allowances" (B68).
* **Scenario 2: Sum of Food & Beverage Revenue Subcategories:** If row 71 falls under the "Food & Beverage" section, cell B71 could be the sum of different food and beverage revenue streams. This would be calculated by adding the revenue from different food and beverage sources.
* **Scenario 3: Total Revenue for a Specific Department:** Cell B71 could also represent the total revenue for a particular department (e.g., Rooms, Food & Beverage, Activities). This would involve summing all revenue line items associated with that department.
* **Scenario 4: Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) or Operating Expenses:** If B71 falls under the expenses section, it could be the sum of different expense categories related to either the cost of goods sold or operating expenses. This would include items like payroll, supplies, or utilities. ## Inferring Calculation Logic from Data To illustrate, let's hypothetically assume cell B71 represents the total "Room Revenue" for January 2025. Based on the data provided, the calculation could be: B71 = B66 + B67 + B68 B71 = 162,077.12 + 123,329.00 + (-12,129.76) B71 = 273,276.36 This result matches the value in cell B11 ("Room Revenue"), indicating that "Room Revenue" (B11) could be the subtotal of the room revenue subcategories. Without the precise Excel formula, this remains an educated guess based on typical P&L structures. ## Key Takeaways and Implications Understanding how subtotals are calculated is crucial for accurate financial analysis and budgeting. It allows you to: * Identify the key drivers of revenue and expenses.
• Track performance against budget.
• Make informed business decisions. By dissecting the P&L and understanding the underlying calculations, you gain a deeper insight into the financial health and performance of Lone Mountain Ranch. To get the definitive answer, you'd need to open the actual Excel file and inspect the formula in cell B71.

### Q9: Formula Understanding (Medium)

**Question**: How is the return percentage calculated for each property in the Rosewood Fund?

**Score**: 3.0/5 ❌

**Response Time**: 7454ms

**Koda's Response**:
```
Okay, I can help you understand how the return percentage is calculated for each property in the Rosewood Fund, based on the provided "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" documents. The documents don't explicitly state a single, universal formula for "return percentage." Instead, they present various financial metrics and percentages that contribute to understanding the performance of different properties within the fund. The return percentages displayed appear to be derived from different calculations depending on the context, such as debt vs. equity, or profit vs. distribution. Let's break down the key areas where return percentages are shown in the documents: ### Analysis of Return Percentage Calculations Here's a breakdown of the return percentages, focusing on where they appear and what they likely represent: * **Debt vs. Equity (Document 5, Row 45 & 46):** The "%" column likely represents the percentage of total sources of funds that are attributable to either debt or equity. For example, in one column, debt is listed as **54%** of the total sources, while equity is listed separately. This isn't a "return" *per se*, but a percentage breakdown of the funding structure. * **LTC (Loan to Cost) (Document 5, Row 49):** The percentages listed under "LTC" most likely represent the Loan-to-Cost ratio for each property. For example, one property has a **LTC** of **58%**. * **IRR (Internal Rate of Return):** While not explicitly calculated, this is a standard metric that factors into the performance of the fund. The document "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf" is about using machine learning for stock selection and portfolio allocation, so it does not contain any information about the Rosewood Fund or its return calculations. ### Practical Implications Here's some actionable guidance based on the information in the Rosewood Fund documents, keeping in mind the absence of a clearly defined "return percentage" formula: * **For Investment Analysis:** * Calculate the Internal Rate of Return (**IRR**) for each property. This will give you a standardized measure of profitability over time, taking into account the time value of money. * Analyze the Debt/Equity mix for each property (Document 5, Rows 45 & 46). A higher debt percentage might indicate higher risk, but also potentially higher returns if the property performs well. * **For Risk Management:** * Monitor the Loan-to-Cost (**LTC**) ratios (Document 5, Row 49). Higher LTC ratios mean the fund has a larger exposure to debt relative to the cost of the project. * Consider implementing risk management strategies outlined in Document 3 (although focused on stocks, the principles apply). This includes setting limits on position sizes (e.g., a maximum of **5%** of portfolio value). ### Bottom Line While the Rosewood Fund documents don't give a single "return percentage" formula, they provide data points to calculate various return and risk metrics. Focus on calculating **IRR**, analyzing debt/equity ratios, and monitoring **LTC** to understand property performance and manage risk effectively.

### Q10: Formula Understanding (Medium)

**Question**: Why does the Rosewood Fund use IFERROR in its formulas?

**Score**: 0.0/5 ❌

**Response Time**: 8831ms

**Issues**:
- Koda could not find the information

**Koda's Response**:
```
Okay, I'm ready to analyze the documents and explain why the Rosewood Fund uses `IFERROR` in its formulas. It looks like the user provided the following documents: * `2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf`
• Two versions of `Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx`
• `2511.12490v1_Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor Drift Regimes.pdf` Let's dive in! The reason the Rosewood Fund uses `IFERROR` in its formulas is primarily to handle potential errors that can arise during calculations, especially when dealing with financial data. These errors can occur due to various reasons, such as division by zero, missing data, or invalid inputs. Using `IFERROR` allows the spreadsheet to continue functioning smoothly without being disrupted by error messages, providing a more user-friendly and robust experience. **1. Handling Potential Calculation Errors** The `IFERROR` function is a standard error-handling function in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. It checks whether a formula results in an error, and if it does, it returns a specified value instead of displaying an error message. This is particularly useful in financial models like the Rosewood Fund's spreadsheet, where numerous calculations are performed, and even a single error can cascade through the entire model. For instance, a common error is division by zero. If a formula involves dividing a value by another value that happens to be zero, the spreadsheet will return a `#DIV/0!` error. Similarly, if a formula references a cell containing an error, it will propagate that error to other cells. `IFERROR` can prevent these errors from disrupting the entire spreadsheet by replacing them with a more manageable value, such as zero or a blank cell. **2. Dealing with Missing or Incomplete Data** Financial datasets often contain missing or incomplete data. This can be due to various reasons, such as data not being available for certain periods, or errors in data collection. When formulas encounter missing data, they may return errors or unexpected results. `IFERROR` can be used to handle these situations gracefully by providing a default value when data is missing. The document `2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf` discusses handling missing data in the context of stock price prediction. It mentions deleting factors or stocks with excessive missing data. While this approach reduces missing data, it doesn't eliminate it entirely. `IFERROR` would be beneficial in calculations using the remaining data to ensure smooth operation. **3. Improving User Experience** Error messages in a spreadsheet can be confusing and intimidating for users who are not familiar with the underlying formulas. `IFERROR` can improve the user experience by replacing these error messages with more informative or user-friendly values. For example, instead of displaying `#VALUE!` or `#N/A`, the spreadsheet could display "Data Not Available" or simply leave the cell blank. This is particularly important for a fund like Rosewood, where multiple people might be using the spreadsheet, not all of whom may be experts in spreadsheet formulas. By using `IFERROR`, the spreadsheet becomes more accessible and easier to understand for a wider range of users. **4. Maintaining Data Integrity** Although `IFERROR` handles errors, it's crucial to understand that it doesn't fix the underlying problem causing the error. It merely masks the error by replacing it with a specified value. Therefore, it's essential to carefully consider the implications of using `IFERROR` and to ensure that the replacement value is appropriate for the context. In some cases, it might be more appropriate to investigate and correct the underlying data or formula that is causing the error, rather than simply masking it with `IFERROR`. However, in situations where errors are expected or unavoidable, such as when dealing with incomplete datasets, `IFERROR` can be a valuable tool for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors from cascading through the spreadsheet. In summary, the Rosewood Fund likely uses `IFERROR` in its formulas to handle potential errors, deal with missing data, improve user experience, and maintain data integrity. This function provides a robust and user-friendly way to manage errors in financial models, ensuring that the spreadsheet continues to function smoothly and provide accurate results.

Alright, let's break down how the \$63M improvement plan relates to Lone Mountain Ranch's investment in the Rosewood Fund, based on the documents you provided. It's a bit like piecing together a puzzle, but we can get a good sense of the relationship by looking at how the fund is structured and how Lone Mountain Ranch might fit into its overall strategy. The **Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx** document provides a detailed financial overview of the fund's investments, sources of capital, and projected returns. While it doesn't explicitly mention a \$63M improvement plan or Lone Mountain Ranch, we can infer connections by examining the fund's investment strategy and financial structure. The document is four pages long. The fund's sources of capital are broken down into debt, equity, and other sources. Let's consider "Equity FUND" details from the **Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx** document. On Row 54 we see investment values for Equity Funds broken down by investment, gross, and net values. For example, one of the investment columns shows \$120 investment, \$307 gross, with a 2.56x return. Now, let's talk about how Lone Mountain Ranch could fit into this. If Lone Mountain Ranch is an investment within the Rosewood Fund, the \$63M improvement plan would likely be funded through a combination of debt and equity, as outlined in the fund's financial structure. This would increase the ranch's value and revenue, contributing to the fund's overall returns. The **Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2024.xlsx** and **Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2025 (Budget).xlsx** documents offer insight into the ranch's financial performance. These documents outline the ranch's revenue and expenses, including specific line items like "Rodeo Revenue" and "Rodeo Expenses." Looking at the "Rodeo Revenue" in **Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2024.xlsx** (Row 440), the total is **\$552,279.07**. The projected "Rodeo Revenue" in **Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2025 (Budget).xlsx** (Row 279) is **\$566,683.99**. This gives us a sense of the ranch's baseline financial activity prior to the improvement plan. The \$63M improvement plan would likely aim to increase these revenue streams through facility upgrades, enhanced guest experiences, and expanded marketing efforts. These efforts would increase the ranch's profitability and, consequently, the value of Rosewood Fund's investment. If the \$63M improvement plan is successful, we would expect to see significant increases in revenue and profitability for Lone Mountain Ranch over the coming years. This would translate into higher returns for the Rosewood Fund and its investors. **Key Takeaways:** * The **Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx** outlines the fund's investment strategy and financial structure, showing how capital is raised and allocated across various investments.
• The **Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2024.xlsx** and **Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2025 (Budget).xlsx** provide a baseline understanding of the ranch's financial performance.
• The \$63M improvement plan would likely be funded through a combination of debt and equity, aiming to increase the ranch's revenue and profitability.
• Successful implementation of the improvement plan would translate into higher returns for the Rosewood Fund and its investors.

### Q14: Complex Calculation (Hard)

**Question**: What is the total amount invested across all properties in the Rosewood Fund?

**Score**: 5.0/5 ✅

**Response Time**: 10261ms

**Koda's Response**:
```
Alright, let's figure out the total amount invested across all properties in the Rosewood Fund, based on the provided documents. After analyzing the three "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" documents (document IDs all starting with `dc67a091`), it appears the most relevant data regarding investment amounts is found in **Row 44** of Document 1. This row is labeled "Sources Total" and seems to represent the total capital deployed. However, pinpointing a single "total amount invested across all properties" is tricky because the data is broken down by what appear to be individual properties or investment categories. To get a comprehensive view, we need to sum up the "Sources Total" across all the columns in **Row 44** of Document 1. Let's do that: * $70 + $10 + $324 + $404 + $100 + $62 + $162 + $20 + $20 + $40 + $16 + $82 + $98 + $206 + $10 + $489 + $705 + $914 = **$3716** Therefore, based on the "Sources Total" row in Document 1, the total amount invested across what appear to be all properties in the Rosewood Fund is approximately **$3,716**. Note that the units are not explicitly stated in the document, so this could be in thousands, millions, etc. It's important to acknowledge some limitations based on the provided data: * **Lack of Clear Units**: The document does not specify the currency or scale (thousands, millions, etc.) of the dollar amounts.
* **Ambiguous Column Headings**: The exact meaning of each column is not fully clear without more context. They likely represent different properties or investment phases.
* **Limited Information**: The provided excerpts are only snippets of the larger spreadsheet, so there may be other relevant information not included. Let's move on to practical implications. **PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS** **For Investment Strategy:** * **Diversification Analysis:** Review the allocation across the various properties/categories identified in Document 1 (Row 44) to assess diversification. Are investments heavily concentrated in a few areas, or is there a balanced spread?
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Compare the "Profit Total" (Row 50) and "Distribution Total" (Row 51) for each property/category against the initial investment ("Sources Total" in Row 44) to identify high-performing and underperforming assets.
* **Equity vs. Debt Allocation:** Analyze the breakdown between "Debt" and "Equity" (Rows 45 and 46) to understand the risk profile of each investment. Consider adjusting the mix based on current market conditions and risk tolerance. For example, if you are risk-averse, you may want to shift your investments towards debt. **For Risk Management:** * **Loan-to-Cost (LTC) Monitoring:** Track the LTC ratios (Row 49) for each property to identify potential over-leveraging. High LTC ratios increase the risk of financial distress if property values decline.
* **Waterfall Analysis:** Review the "Waterfall" section (Rows 52 and 53) to understand how returns are distributed to investors at different stages. Ensure the waterfall structure aligns with your investment goals and risk appetite.
* **Fee Structure Review:** Examine the "Hotel Fees" (Document 2, Row 62) and "MF/PIF on Equity Fund" (Document 3, Rows 55 and 56) to assess the impact of fees on overall returns. Negotiate lower fees where possible to improve profitability. **For Financial Modeling:** * **Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct sensitivity analysis on key assumptions (e.g., occupancy rates, rental income, operating expenses) to understand how changes in these factors could impact investment returns.
* **Scenario Planning:** Develop different scenarios (e.g., best case, worst case, base case) to assess the potential range of outcomes for each property/category. This will help you prepare for unforeseen events.
* **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis:** Use DCF analysis to estimate the present value of future cash flows from each property/category. This will help you determine whether the investments are generating adequate returns relative to their risk. **Bottom line:** Based on the "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" documents, the total investment across all properties appears to be approximately $3,716. However, further investigation is needed to clarify the units and confirm the accuracy of this figure. You should perform a thorough review of the portfolio's diversification, performance, and risk profile. It is important to continuously monitor LTC ratios and fee structures. Finally, conduct sensitivity analyses and scenario planning to assess the potential impact of changing market conditions.

### Q15: Complex Calculation (Hard)

**Question**: What is the average MoIC across all properties in the Rosewood Fund?

**Score**: 5.0/5 ✅

**Response Time**: 9388ms

**Koda's Response**:
```
The average **MoIC** (Multiple on Invested Capital) across all properties in the **Rosewood Fund** isn't directly stated as a single, calculated average in the provided documents. However, we can identify several **MoIC** values for individual properties or scenarios within the **Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx** documents and sheet. We can discuss these values individually to get a sense of the range of **MoIC** within the fund. The term **MoIC** is crucial to understand here. It's a ratio that represents how much money an investment has generated relative to the amount of money invested. A **MoIC** of **2.0x** means that for every dollar invested, two dollars were returned. This is a key metric in evaluating the success of a real estate fund. ## Breakdown of MoIC Values in Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx Several instances of **MoIC** values can be found in the provided snippets from the **Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx** documents. These values appear in different contexts, representing different properties or scenarios within the fund's overall performance. It is important to note that extracting a precise, weighted average **MoIC** across *all* properties would require the full dataset and deeper financial modeling, which is beyond the scope of the provided document excerpts. * **Document 1, Row 6:** Shows a **MoIC NET** of **2.43**. This appears to be a general or summary metric, possibly representing the overall net **MoIC** for the fund, or a specific portfolio within the fund.
* **Document 1, Row 7:** Shows a **MoIC NET simple formula** of **2.51**. This could be another version of the **MoIC**, perhaps calculated using a slightly different formula or set of assumptions.
* **Document 2, Row 58:** Contains a series of **MoIC** values, such as **2.74x**, **3.13x**, **2.47x**, and **2.17x**. These likely represent the **MoIC** for individual properties or investments within the fund.
* **Document 4, Row 54:** Contains **MoIC** values such as **2.56x**, **3.25x**, **3.29x**, **3.79x**, **2.94x**, and **2.61x**. These, like the values in Document 2, probably represent the **MoIC** for specific projects or assets. ## Analysis of MoIC Values Analyzing these **MoIC** values, we can make a few key observations. * The **MoIC** values vary significantly across different properties, ranging from around **2.17x** to **3.79x**. This indicates that some properties within the **Rosewood Fund** have performed much better than others.
• The overall **MoIC NET** reported in **Document 1** (**2.43x** or **2.51x**) likely represents an average or aggregate performance across the entire fund or a specific portfolio, reflecting the combined performance of all individual properties.
• The higher **MoIC** values suggest successful individual investments, while the lower values may indicate properties that have underperformed or are still in the early stages of development, where returns have not yet fully materialized. Without knowing the specific investment amounts associated with each property, it's impossible to calculate a precise weighted average. However, these values offer insights into the fund's performance. ## Implications and Key Takeaways The range of **MoIC** values highlights the importance of diversification within the **Rosewood Fund**. By investing in a portfolio of properties, the fund can mitigate the risk associated with any single underperforming asset. The overall **MoIC NET** suggests that, on average, the fund has generated a positive return for investors. Furthermore, the data suggests that some properties are significantly outperforming others. This information could be used to inform future investment decisions, focusing on strategies and locations that have historically yielded higher returns. In summary, while a single average **MoIC** cannot be calculated from the provided snippets, the available data provides a valuable snapshot of the performance of individual properties within the **Rosewood Fund**. This information can be used to assess the fund's overall success and inform future investment strategies.

### Q16: Complex Calculation (Hard)

**Question**: If the $63M improvement plan increases Lone Mountain Ranch's value by 40%, what is the return on investment?

**Score**: 4.3/5 ✅

**Response Time**: 5380ms

**Koda's Response**:
```
Okay, let's break down the return on investment for the Lone Mountain Ranch improvement plan. Based on the information provided, we can't directly calculate the ROI without knowing the initial value of Lone Mountain Ranch. However, we can outline the calculation if we had that figure. If the **\$63M** improvement plan increases the ranch's value by **40%**, the *increase in value* would be **40%** of the *original value*. To calculate the ROI, you would use the formula: **(Increase in Value - Cost of Improvement) / Cost of Improvement**. For example, let's assume the initial value of the ranch was **\$100M**. A **40%** increase would be **\$40M**. Therefore, the ROI would be **(\$40M - \$63M) / \$63M = -0.365**, or **-36.5%**. This would represent a loss on the investment. The document "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" contains financial data, but does not contain the initial value of Lone Mountain Ranch. Therefore, the document provides no information for calculating the return on investment.

### Q17: Complex Calculation (Hard)

**Question**: What is the weighted average return across the Rosewood Fund portfolio, weighted by investment size?

**Score**: 5.0/5 ✅

**Response Time**: 5114ms

**Koda's Response**:
```
Based on the provided documents, I can calculate a weighted average return for the Rosewood Fund portfolio. From the "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" document (Row 57), we can extract the investment sizes and returns for each investment. To calculate the weighted average return, we'll multiply each investment's return by its respective investment size. Then, we sum these weighted returns and divide by the total investment size. **Calculations:** * (28% \* \$21) + (29% \* \$36) + (33% \* \$212) + (25% \* \$155) + (14% \* \$71) = \$133.47
• Total Investment = \$21 + \$36 + \$212 + \$155 + \$71 = \$495
• Weighted Average Return = (\$133.47 / \$495) = 26.96% Therefore, the weighted average return across the Rosewood Fund portfolio, weighted by investment size, is approximately **26.96%**. **PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:** **For Portfolio Allocation:** * Consider using mean-variance optimization to allocate stocks, as mentioned in the "2511.12129v1\_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf" document. This approach balances risk and return by modeling individual asset weights.
• Implement constraints similar to those used in the document (Long only: upper bound 5% and Lower bound 0%, Fully invest our capital: sum of weights=100%). **For Risk Management:** * Implement volatility and drawdown controls, as discussed in "2511.12490v1\_Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor Drift Regimes.pdf". Consider a scaling factor based on a 12% annual volatility cap and a 15% maximum drawdown constraint.
• Establish a dynamic kill-switch to shut down the strategy entirely if losses exceed historical norms (e.g., absolute drawdown from peak exceeds 30% or rolling 63-day performance falls below -10%). **For Transaction Costs:** * Factor in transaction costs. The "2511.12490v1\_Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor Drift Regimes.pdf" document uses 0.6 basis points per unit traded. **Bottom line**: Focus on balancing risk and return through optimized portfolio allocation and robust risk management strategies, while also accounting for transaction costs.

### Q18: Business Analysis (Hard)

**Question**: Based on the 2024 actual and 2025 budget, is Lone Mountain Ranch becoming more or less profitable?

**Score**: 3.9/5 ✅

**Response Time**: 5879ms

**Koda's Response**:
```
Based on the provided documents, it's difficult to definitively say whether Lone Mountain Ranch is becoming more or less profitable. We can compare revenue and expense budgets, but a true profit comparison requires more detailed profit/loss figures. Looking at **Total Operating Revenue**, the "Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2024.xlsx" document shows **$23,040,535.15** for the year. The "Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2025 (Budget).xlsx" projects **$23,729,395.98** in revenue, an increase. However, we also need to consider expenses. For example, "Lone Mountain Ranch P&L 2024.xlsx" lists **Total Rodeo Revenue** as **$552,279.07** with corresponding **Total Rodeo Expenses** of **$104,337.97**. The budget for 2025 shows **Total Rodeo Revenue** of **$566,683.99**. Without expense data, it's hard to know if rodeo profit is increasing. A comprehensive comparison of all revenue streams *and* their associated expenses would provide the needed insight on overall profitability trends.

Based on the provided documents, it's difficult to definitively say which *property* has performed best in the Rosewood Fund, as the documents don't provide granular performance data at the individual property level. However, we can analyze the fund's overall performance and strategies, and infer some insights. The "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" document gives some high-level financial data and the "2511.12490v1_Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor Drift Regimes.pdf" document discusses a high-performing strategy, which may or may not be related to the Rosewood Fund. The "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" document contains financial information; however, it does not specify the performance of individual properties. Instead, it provides figures related to distributions, life (presumably of the fund), management fees (MF), and performance incentive fees (PIF). The document includes sections labeled with numbers, percentages, and dollar amounts, but without clear property names or identifiers, it's challenging to isolate individual property performance. The "2511.12490v1_Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor Drift Regimes.pdf" document details a "Unicorn Edge" strategy that achieved remarkable out-of-sample performance. This strategy attained a Sharpe ratio of **13.19**, total out-of-sample return of **+10,938%** over three test years, and a wealth multiple of **110.4x**. While impressive, it's not explicitly linked to the Rosewood Fund or specific properties. The "2511.13614v1_Market-Dependent Communication in Multi-Agent Alph.pdf" document discusses multi-agent strategies in a competitive environment. The agents propose different strategies and react to market conditions. The document mentions stocks A, B, C, and D with returns of **45.2%** and **18.3%**. It is difficult to correlate this information with the Rosewood Fund data, however. The document "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf" describes a machine-learning approach to stock selection. The methodology uses models like Ridge regression and Random Forest to optimize stock selection. The document does not contain specific information to determine which property has performed the best. **For Strategy:** * **Consider the Unicorn Edge strategy:** If applicable to the Rosewood Fund, the strategy's high Sharpe ratio (**13.19**) and substantial returns (**+10,938%**) suggest it could be a successful model.
* **Explore multi-agent strategies:** The document "2511.13614v1_Market-Dependent Communication in Multi-Agent Alph.pdf" suggests that using a multi-agent approach can improve performance.
* **Consider the Machine Learning approach:** The document "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf" suggests a machine learning approach can improve performance.
* **Analyze fees:** Review the "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" document to understand the impact of management fees (**1.0%**) and performance incentive fees (**20%**) on overall returns. Evaluate if these fees align with the fund's performance. **For Risk Management:** * **Implement Dynamic Stop-Loss:** As suggested in "2511.13614v1_Market-Dependent Communication in Multi-Agent Alph.pdf", use a dynamic stop-loss strategy based on signal volatility. Widen stops during strong alignment and tighten during divergence.
* **Limit Position Sizes:** As mentioned in "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf", limit position sizes to a maximum of **5%** of portfolio value.
* **Factor in transaction costs:** As mentioned in "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf", consider transaction costs when rebalancing the portfolio. **For Portfolio Optimization:** * **Minimize Variance and Maximize Sharpe Ratio:** Use portfolio optimization methods to minimize variance and maximize the Sharpe ratio, as indicated in "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf".
* **Balance High-Growth and Steady-Growth Assets:** As suggested in "2511.13614v1_Market-Dependent Communication in Multi-Agent Alph.pdf", balance high-growth assets (like Stock A) with steady-growth assets (like Stock B) to optimize risk-adjusted returns.
* **Adjust Portfolio Weights:** As mentioned in "2511.12129v1_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic.pdf", adjust portfolio weights based on predicted returns from selected models. **Bottom line:** While specific property performance data is lacking, the "Unicorn Edge" strategy and multi-agent approaches outlined in the provided documents offer potential avenues for optimizing the Rosewood Fund's overall performance and risk management. Further analysis with property-level data is needed to determine the best-performing assets.

### Q20: Business Analysis (Hard)

**Question**: If I have an additional $10M to invest, should I put it into the $63M improvement plan or invest in a new property? Explain your reasoning based on the data.

**Score**: 3.3/5 ❌

**Response Time**: 7896ms

**Koda's Response**:
```
Okay, let's figure out the best way to invest that extra **$10M**. Based on the documents, it appears the wisest move is to invest it into the **$63M** improvement plan, but let's break down the reasoning. The primary document for making this decision is "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx." This document outlines the sources of funds and their allocation. Specifically, it shows how capital is being used for different projects. The other documents, "2511.13614v1_Market-Dependent Communication in Multi-Agent Alph.pdf" and "2511.11481v1_Risk-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic.pdf", deal with trading strategies and risk management in a competitive environment, so they are less relevant to this specific investment decision. Looking at the "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx" document, we can see the existing funding sources and their allocation. Row **44** shows the "Sources Total" for various investment categories. To make a sound decision, we need to understand how adding **$10M** to the existing **$63M** improvement plan affects the overall returns and risk profile compared to investing in a new property. Unfortunately, this document doesn't provide explicit ROI or risk assessments for new property investments. Without detailed financial projections for a new property, it's safer to bolster the existing improvement plan. Row **50** shows "Profit Total" and Row **51** shows "Distribution Total," giving some indication of overall financial health. Injecting **$10M** into the existing plan could potentially increase these totals. **Here's a structured summary to guide your decision:** **For Strategy:**
• Enhance the current **$63M** improvement plan with the additional **$10M**. This is because the existing plan has some visibility, and it would make it a total of **$73M**.
• Leverage the existing infrastructure and management already in place for the current project. **For Risk Management:**
• Avoid the uncertainties associated with a new property investment, such as unexpected costs or market fluctuations.
• Focus on optimizing the returns from a project that is already in progress, thus reducing overall portfolio risk. **For Financial Optimization:**
• Analyze the potential increase in "Profit Total" and "Distribution Total" (from "Rosewood Fund v3.xlsx") by adding the **$10M** to the improvement plan.
• Compare this potential ROI with projected returns from a new property investment (if available) before making a final decision. **Bottom line:** In the absence of detailed financial projections for a new property, investing the **$10M** into the existing **$63M** improvement plan appears to be the more prudent and lower-risk option. This allows for better control and predictability of returns.
