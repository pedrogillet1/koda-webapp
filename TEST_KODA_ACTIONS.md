# KODA Actions Testing Guide

## Quick Test Scenarios

Test these queries in KODA to verify all fixes are working:

---

## ‚úÖ Test 1: Create Folder (Should Actually Create)

**Query:** `"Create a folder named 'Test Projects'"`

**Expected Response:**
```
Folder "Test Projects" created successfully.
```

**Verify:**
1. Check KODA's response is not just "OK I will do it"
2. Navigate to your folders in the UI - "Test Projects" should appear
3. Try to create the same folder again - should say "already exists"

---

## ‚úÖ Test 2: Rename Folder (Should Actually Rename)

**Query:** `"rename the pedro1 folder to pedro_renamed"`

**Expected Response:**
```
Folder renamed from "pedro1" to "pedro_renamed".
```

**Verify:**
1. Folder "pedro1" no longer exists
2. Folder "pedro_renamed" now exists
3. All documents that were in "pedro1" are now in "pedro_renamed"
4. Subfolders have updated paths

---

## ‚úÖ Test 3: Move Files with Semantic Search (Anti-Hallucination Test)

**Setup:** First create a target folder:
```
"Create a folder named 'Koda Documents'"
```

**Query:** `"Move all documents related to Koda to the Koda Documents folder"`

**Expected Response:**
```
Successfully moved 3 document(s) to "Koda Documents":
Koda Business Plan.pdf, Koda Blueprint.pdf, Koda Presentation.pptx
```

**CRITICAL VERIFICATION - No Hallucinations:**
1. ‚úÖ Check that response ONLY mentions files that actually exist in your system
2. ‚ùå Response should NOT mention "koda advogados.pdf" or any made-up filenames
3. ‚úÖ All mentioned files should now be in the "Koda Documents" folder
4. ‚úÖ The file count in the response should match the actual number of files moved

---

## ‚úÖ Test 4: Show PDF Documents Related to Koda (Content Search, Not Filename)

**Query:** `"Show me all PDF documents related to Koda"`

**Expected Response:**
```
I found 5 documents related to "Koda":

In Koda Business Plan.pdf: [relevant excerpt]
In Montana Hotel Analysis.pdf: [mentions Koda Sanctuary project]
In Blueprint.pdf: [discusses Koda architecture]
...
```

**Verify:**
1. ‚úÖ Response includes ALL documents that MENTION Koda (not just files with "Koda" in the name)
2. ‚úÖ Each result says "In [Document Name]:" with the actual content
3. ‚ùå Response does NOT say "I couldn't find any files" if documents exist

---

## ‚úÖ Test 5: Summarize Specific Document

**Query:** `"Summarize the ICP document"`

**Expected Response:**
```
The ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) document outlines [actual summary content from the document].
```

**Verify:**
1. ‚úÖ Response is a SUMMARY of the document content (not "what's in the folder")
2. ‚úÖ Response includes specific facts from the document
3. ‚ùå Response does NOT say "I couldn't find a folder named..."

---

## ‚úÖ Test 6: Find Duplicates

**Query:** `"Find duplicates in my documents"`

**Expected Response:**
```
Found 2 group(s) of duplicate files (3.5 MB wasted space):

Group 1: Business_Plan.pdf (2 copies)
- Business_Plan.pdf in Work folder (Jan 15, 2025)
- Business_Plan.pdf in Backup folder (Jan 20, 2025)

Group 2: Invoice_2024.pdf (3 copies)
- Invoice_2024.pdf in Finance folder (Dec 1, 2024)
- Invoice_2024 (1).pdf in Finance folder (Dec 5, 2024)
- Invoice_2024 (2).pdf in Downloads folder (Dec 10, 2024)
```

**Verify:**
1. ‚úÖ Lists actual duplicate files (same SHA-256 hash)
2. ‚úÖ Shows location of each copy
3. ‚úÖ Calculates wasted space

---

## ‚úÖ Test 7: What's in a Folder (Navigation, Not Content)

**Query:** `"What's in the EOY F3 folder?"`

**Expected Response:**
```
The folder EOY F3 contains:
‚Ä¢ Documents (3): Biology.docx, Chemistry.pdf, Physics.xlsx
‚Ä¢ Subfolders (1): Lab Reports
```

**Verify:**
1. ‚úÖ Lists files and subfolders in the folder
2. ‚úÖ Uses structured format (not paragraph)
3. ‚ùå Does NOT try to summarize document content

---

## üî¥ Edge Cases to Test

### Edge Case 1: Folder Already Exists
**Query:** `"Create a folder named 'Test Projects'"` (run twice)

**Expected 2nd Response:**
```
A folder named "Test Projects" already exists in this location.
```

---

### Edge Case 2: Folder Not Found
**Query:** `"Rename the XYZ_NonExistent folder to ABC"`

**Expected Response:**
```
Folder "XYZ_NonExistent" not found.
```

---

### Edge Case 3: No Matching Documents
**Query:** `"Move all documents about dinosaurs to Science folder"`

**Expected Response:**
```
No documents found matching your criteria for "documents about dinosaurs".
```

**CRITICAL:** Should NOT say "I will move koda_dinosaurs.pdf" (hallucination)

---

### Edge Case 4: Target Folder Doesn't Exist
**Query:** `"Move all PDFs to the NonExistentFolder"`

**Expected Response:**
```
Target folder "NonExistentFolder" not found. Please create it first.
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tips

### Check Database Directly

**View all folders:**
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma studio
# Navigate to "folders" table
```

**Check folder after creation:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, path, userId FROM folders WHERE name='Test Projects';
```

**Check documents in folder:**
```sql
SELECT d.filename, f.name as folder_name
FROM documents d
LEFT JOIN folders f ON d.folderId = f.id
WHERE f.name = 'Koda Documents';
```

---

### Check Backend Logs

Look for these log patterns:

**CREATE_FOLDER:**
```
üìÅ [CREATE_FOLDER] Creating folder: "Test Projects" for user: user-123
‚úÖ [CREATE_FOLDER] Successfully created folder: uuid-456
```

**MOVE_FILES:**
```
üì¶ [MOVE_FILES] Moving files to "Koda Documents"
   Query: "Move all documents related to Koda..."
‚úÖ [MOVE_FILES] Successfully moved 3 documents
```

**Anti-Hallucination Check:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  [MOVE_FILES] AI hallucinated non-existent files: fake_file.pdf
```
If you see this warning, the AI tried to make up a file but was caught!

---

## üö® Known Issues (Should NOT Happen)

### ‚ùå BAD: KODA Says "OK I will do it" but Nothing Happens
**If this happens:** The action handler is not being called correctly.
**Check:** Backend logs for the specific intent detection

### ‚ùå BAD: AI Mentions Files That Don't Exist
**If this happens:** The document list grounding failed.
**Check:** `moveFiles()` function in fileActions.service.ts

### ‚ùå BAD: "Summarize the ICP document" ‚Üí "I couldn't find a folder"
**If this happens:** Intent classification is wrong.
**Check:** Pattern matching in patternIntent.service.ts

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

All fixes are working correctly if:
1. ‚úÖ CREATE_FOLDER actually creates a folder in the database
2. ‚úÖ RENAME_FOLDER actually renames the folder (not just says "OK")
3. ‚úÖ MOVE_FILES only mentions files that exist (no hallucinations)
4. ‚úÖ "Summarize X" goes to RAG (not folder navigation)
5. ‚úÖ "Show me PDFs related to X" does semantic search (not filename search)
6. ‚úÖ FIND_DUPLICATES returns actual duplicate groups
7. ‚úÖ Error messages are clear and helpful

---

## üìû Need Help?

If any test fails:
1. Check the `KODA_FIX_SUMMARY.md` for implementation details
2. Review backend logs for error messages
3. Verify database state with Prisma Studio
4. Check that patternIntent.service.ts is correctly classifying intents

**Implementation Status:** ‚úÖ All core functionality completed and integrated!
